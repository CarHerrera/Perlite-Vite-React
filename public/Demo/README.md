# Welcome

This is a website that uses the open-source Perlite to host my notes online.  Perlite does not support excalidraw out of the box and this was a plugin that I felt was necessary for my notes. To make excalidraw work with Perlite, I used Vite and React to host all the modules that are needed for excalidraw. I used a vite-php  to use vite as a backend-integration and continued using perlite as the host for my notes.
