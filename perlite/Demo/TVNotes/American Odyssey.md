After Sgt. Odelle Ballard (Anna Friel) discovers a computer file that implicates a major US corporation of funding Jihadists, her unit is murdered by US Special Forces, just as former U.S. Attorney Peter Decker (Peter Facinelli) tackles a merger with the corporation, and political activist Harrison Walters (Jake Robinson) hears from a hacker about evidence of an international military conspiracy. The three strangers must come together to expose the people behind the conspiracy before they and their families face more danger.
