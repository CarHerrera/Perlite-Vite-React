Oscar winner Mira Sorvino stars as NYPD detective Kate Morozov in this two-part Lifetime telefilm.  Morozov joins the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and teams up with Bill Meehan (Donald Sutherland) to track down the leader of an international sex trafficking ring preying on young eastern European women. Through the series, we follow the stories of several characters who experience the terror of human trafficking, the buying and selling of people, in different parts of the world.
