Matthew Perry stars as Ben Donovan, the self-involved manager of a second-rate San Diego sports arena who begins to re-evaluate his life on his 40th birthday. Working alongside him is his boss and arena owner, Crystal-attractive, powerful and highly erratic; Alice-the cute, tomboyish marketing director and Ben's friend with benefits; Alonzo-a former basketball player, handsome and unbelievably happy; Ben's assistant, Heather-pretty, sweet, but terrifying because she once lit a boyfriend on fire; Crystal's son, Roman-sweet-faced, clueless and Ben's newest employee; and a hapless operations crew whom Ben refers to collectively as the "Steves."
