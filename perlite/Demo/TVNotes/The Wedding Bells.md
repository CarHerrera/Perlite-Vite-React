The Wedding Bells tells the story of three young sisters who inherit the family business -- otherwise known as The Wedding Palace. The show centres on this family owned wedding planning business that supposedly sees that its clients live happily ever after, or at least until the honeymoon!The Wedding Bells was produced by 20th Century FOX Television in association with David E. Kelley Productions (creator of Ally McBeal, Boston Legal and The Practice),and distributed by the FOX Television Network. The series was given a 13 episode initial order by Fox but that was cut short to only 7 episodes due to poor ratings and thus the show was suddenly cancelled really before it ever got going.
