CBS and CTV team up yet again to offer American and Canadian audiences the police drama, The Bridge. Like Flashpoint, this dramatic series will straddle both networks. The show follows Frank Leo, a newly elected police union head with an angry attitude and no patience for the corruption that permeates the force.
