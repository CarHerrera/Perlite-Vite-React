Drive follows the lives of a group of Americans racing each other in a sinister and possibly fatal cross-country race. Each person has a special reason to compete - and each person strives to win because of these reasons. Among the racers are two brothers in a stolen, pimped-out Cadillac that carries secrets of its own, a man trying to find his missing wife, a scientist and his teenage daughter, and others. No one knows who they're racing or where the finish line is, so anything is possible.
