Based loosely on the 2000 film of the same name, where a group of 20-something small-time con artists (Charlie Cavendish (Rupert Grint), Albert Hill (Luke Pasqualino), Billy Ayres (Lucien Laviscount), and Lotti Mott (Phoebe Dynevor)) come across a truck full of stolen gold bullion and end up in the cross hairs of organized crime.
