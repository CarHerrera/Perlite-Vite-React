Four celebrity artists each will form teams of singers that they will coach and mentor throughout the competition.  Individuals will be eliminated until each celebrity only has one team member left who will compete in the finals to be named "The Voice of America" in a live finale. In order for the most talented to be picked, the audition process is blind...the coaches can only hear the singers performing and cannot see them.
