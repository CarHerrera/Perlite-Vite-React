A 43 year old narrator, who is incredibly rich and successful. Looks all the way back to 1994. When he lost his innocence and started to become a man - at the age of 32. In 1994 Glen Abbott (Rob Corddry), still living with his parents, finally steps out into the world and tries to make something of himself when the only girl he'd ever kissed, the radiant Alison McKellar (Erinn Hayes), returns to town. Driven by the desire to become a success and win Alison's heart, Glen goes through his "wonder years" a mere 20 years older than, well most everyone. However, it's not in vain, as this unlikely underdog will eventually transform from fear-riddled underachiever to the richest man in Buffalo in a mere five years. Luckily, Glen doesn't have to go though this awkward period alone. He becomes best friends with the only person he can truly relate to: Alison's 13-year-old son Josh (Keir Gilchrist). Josh is also fellow hypochondriac, and they help each other survive "puberty". Glen also receives parental guidance from his absurdly enabling mother Irene (Linda Hart) and his supportive but quasi rage-a-holic dad Ron (Lenny Clarke).
