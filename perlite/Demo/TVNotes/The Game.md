THE GAME stars Tia Mowry as Melanie Barnett, a young, intelligent medical student, who is also the girlfriend of an eager rookie football player, Derwin Davis (Pooch Hall). Melanie decides to pass on her chance at attending Johns Hopkins Medical School to be with Derwin after he is recently chosen to play for the San Diego Sabres as the new third-string wide receiver.
As Melanie tries to adjust to her new lifestyle, she meets Tasha Mack (Wendy Raquel Robinson), single mother and manager of Malik Wright (Hosea Chanzes) who is a charming star quarterback for the San Diego Sabres and Kelly Pitts (Brittany Daniel), the satisfying wife of Jason Pitts (Coby Bell) who is a thrifty star player for the San Diego Sabres. With the help of Tasha and Kelly, Melanie learns how the game is played amongst the women behind the athletes.
