Set 58 years prior to the events of Battlestar Galactica (2003), this prequel will explore the lives of two families: the Graystones - including father Daniel, a computer genius, mother Amanda, a brilliant surgeon and their daughter, Zoe - and the Adamas, focusing on Joseph, a lawyer, Sam, his gangster brother, and Willie and Tamara, Joseph's children. The two families are on opposing sides of the decision to create the Cylons: intelligent robots that will one day rebel and nearly annihilate the residents of Caprica. Touted as "television's first science fiction family saga," Caprica is from Battlestar Galactica (2003) executive producers, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick. The show is produced by NBC Universal Television.
