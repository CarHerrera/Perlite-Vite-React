Sanctuary, the first broadcast caliber Sci-Fi series developed specifically for the Internet and the first to be filmed entirely on Green Screen, stars Amanda Tapping as Dr. Helen Magnus, one of the first female doctors in the Royal College during Victorian England. Dr. Magnus takes over her fathers' sanctuary for supernatural creatures, collected from all over the world. In her work with these creatures, Dr. Magnus has received age longevity. She is joined by her daughter Ashley, played by Emilie Ullerup, and young psychiatric resident Dr. Will Zimmerman, played by Robin Dunne, who may have what it takes to become her new protégé.
