Sin Is In!

This hit British comedy series began 1992 and remains one of the BBC's highest rated and most popular shows.

Absolutely Fabulous follows the lives of three (and later four) generations of the Monsoon family and the people around them.

It began as a short French & Saunders sketch with Jennifer Saunders in her familiar role as Edina and Dawn French playing her daughter. A pilot for the series was filmed with the comediennes in those respective roles but Julia Sawalha was cast to replace French. Add a dash of actress Joanna Lumley and the immensly popular and entertaining series was born.

Wheel's on fire,
Rolling down the road!
Best notify my next of kin,
This wheel shall explode!
