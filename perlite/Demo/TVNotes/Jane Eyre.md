Having endured humiliation and loneliness in the home of her heartless Aunt Reed and the harsh regime of Lowood, a charity boarding school, the orphaned Jane Eyre survives her childhood unbroken in spirit and integrity. When she takes up a post as a governess at Thornfield Hall, she also finds love with her employer, the dark and sardonic Mr Rochester. But her discovery of Rochester´s terrible secret forces Jane to follow her moral convictions, even if it means giving up her chance of happiness.
