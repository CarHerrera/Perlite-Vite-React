An FBI agent with uncouth yet effective tactics is played by Patrick Swayze on A&E's The Beast.  Charles Barker (Swayze) trains new partner Ellis Dove (Travis Fimmel).  Baker imparts his hard-driving and slick methods even while an internal affairs squad is investigating him.

The troublemaker veteran makes his new partner sweat as they work undercover, using clever manipulation to continually test Dove and drive him deeper into the "roles" they play on each case.

Dove struggles to do the job the way he's being taught while facing pressure to spy on his veteran partner to support the internal affairs investigation.
