Roseanne was one of the most successful series of the late '80s and early '90s. It always received great ratings and was awarded with 4 Emmys, 3 Golden Globes and 4 American Comedy Awards. The show ran from 1988 to 1997 and ended with one of the most original (and confusing for some) endings in TV history.Set in small town Lanford Illinois, the show followed The Conners, a blue collar family with a humerous backbone, through the trials of: life, marriage, raising a family, and making ends meet.
