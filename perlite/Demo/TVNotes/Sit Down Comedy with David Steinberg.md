A comedian himself, as well as a director (Mad About You, Curb Your Enthusiasm) and producer, David Steinberg hosts a 6-episode series on TV Land interviewing a single comedian in each half-hour episode.  The one-on-one format allows the guests plenty of time to talk about their background, movies or TV shows they have done, and tell funny stories about their lives and careers.
