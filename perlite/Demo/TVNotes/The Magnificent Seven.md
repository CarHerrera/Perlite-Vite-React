This is the story of seven men, each with his own dark secret, who band together to become known as the Magnificent Seven. They learn from each other as they protect those who can not protect themselves. These men include their leader, Chris Larabee: a man running from the pain of his past, Vin Tanner: a sharpshooter, bounty hunter and fugitive, Nathan Jackson: a former slave turned healer, JD Dunne: the kid of the gang, good with a gun but has little experience with real life, Erza Standish: a gambler and con artist, Josiah Sanchez: a former priest fighting off his personal demons and Buck Willington: a ladies man with a heart of gold.  This show is based on the movie series  from the 60s and 70s, which was in turn based on the 1954 Japanese film "Seven Samurai" by Akira Kurosawa. This show was cancelled by CBS after the first season and was later renewed thanks to a large internet campaign to save the show. The show was again cancelled halfway through its second season run. CBS agreed to air the remaining six episodes, but due to low ratings CBS only aired two of the reaming six episodes. About a year later, TNN aired the entire series.
