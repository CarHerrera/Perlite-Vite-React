Making the Band -- the start of O-Town -- the brainchild of teen-pop Svengali Lou Pearlman, the former manager of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync. Equal parts the Monkees and MTV's The Real World, the show offered viewers a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of a boy band, from their first audition to the signing of their first record deal. The show was a modest hit for ABC. More importantly for Pearlman, the show created legions of fans for O-Town before they even released their first album.
