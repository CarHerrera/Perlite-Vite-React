Everything matters at a wedding, and the smallest imperfections can reverberate throughout the event as if lives actually hang in the balance. Things are about to get even more complicated for Danny and Alice, as their day turns into a season-long roller coaster where nothing goes according to plan. Over the course of an entire season, each episode will focus on one day - Danny and Alice's wedding day.
