Under the command of Captain Jonathan Archer, the crew of the first warp five starship (the Enterprise NX-01) begin to explore the galaxy. As their mission progresses, the crew encounter familiar races like the Klingons and Andorians as well as some new ones.Starting in the first episode, the Enterprise crew discover their time has become a front in the mysterious Temporal Cold War. They sometimes find themselves up against the Suliban, an aggressive race that is apart of a faction of the war and given orders by an unknown being from the future. In the second season finale, things take a deadly turn when an alien race named the Xindi attack Earth. With the Xindi preparing another attack and humanity facing destruction, the Enterprise crew have only one option. The third season sees the crew searching the mysterious Delphic Expanse for the Xindi and trying to stop them before their next attack. The fourth season has the crew back home and opening up brand new adventures, one with special guest Brent Spiner. As of season four, T'Pol has officially left the Vulcan High Command and joined Starfleet Command, she has been promoted to Commander.The theme tune for Enterprise is titled "Faith of the Heart", performed by Russell Watson and written by Diane Warren.
