Jimmy Keene (Taron Egerton) was sentenced to 10 years in a minimum security prison with no possibility of parole but is given a choice of a shorter sentence if he enters a maximum-security prison for the criminally insane and can elicit a confession from serial killer Larry Hall (Paul Walter Hauser) in the Dennis Lehane adaptation of James Keene and Hillel Levin's memoir "In With The Devil: A Fallen Hero, A Serial Killer, and A Dangerous Bargain for Redemption."
