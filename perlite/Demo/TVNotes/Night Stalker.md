Crime reporter Carl Kolchak is partnered with Perri Reed at The Beacon, a Los Angeles newspaper. Together they investigate a string of strange murders...all of which may be related to the death of Kolchak's wife 18 months earlier in a similarly bizarre manner. A murder that the FBI consider Kolchak the primary suspect. 

As of 5/17/05, ABC has announced that the remake of the 1970s cult series Kolchak: The Night Stalker which starred Darren McGavin, is part of their fall schedule. The project, which is set up at Touchstone Television, is the result of Spotnitz's overall deal at the studio. "Stalker" revolves around a hardboiled journalist, Carl Kolchak, and his investigations into freakish occurrences.
