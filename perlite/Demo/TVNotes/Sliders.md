In his basement in San Francisco, boy-genius Quinn Mallory unlocks the doorway to an infinite number of parallel Earths. During a test run, Quinn invites co-worker Wade Wells and his teacher Professor Maximillian Arturo to see his new invention. However, an increase in power and an early departure leave all three, plus a washed-up soul singer named Rembrandt "Crying Man" Brown, lost in a parallel world. Now they must "slide" from world to world, not only adapting to their changing surroundings, but also trying to get home.

Sliders was produced by St. Clare Entertainment and filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in its first two seasons. Filming moved to Los Angeles, California, United States for the last three seasons.
