"International film star Gabriel Byrne (End
of Days, The Usual Suspects) comes to television in a new comedy from Golden Globe Award-winning writer Cindy Chupack (Sex and the City), which examines the lives of three generations of men making their way through the dating world."

"Byrne stars as Benjamin Madigan, a handsome, successful and charismatic architect in New York City. He is single, adorable and available and should be making out like a bandit with the ladies. But Benjamin is recently divorced, and after 20 years of being a dutiful husband and provider, he just hasn't got a clue about dating. He is a member of a rare breed of men -- the sexy man completely oblivious to his own sexiness. While his co-workers shove him into the dating world, he is full of the most rudimentary questions, like how soon to call a woman after she gives you her number. For the answers to these and many other questions, Ben can turn to his 16-year-old son, Luke (John Hensley), for whom juggling a series of girlfriends couldn't come more naturally. In addition, Ben's recently widowed father, Seamus (Roy Dotrice, TV's Beauty and the Beast), has just moved in. Seamus is ornery and speaks his mind, and with Luke's help, they might just be able to teach Benjamin a thing or two about dating and women in the 21st century." (ABC press release)

"You took me by the hand
You made me understand
You taught me who I am
And how to be a man
For better or for worse
A bless and not a curse
But just a father's verse
To tell you that you're first
To tell you that you're mad"

Theme song
"Father's Son"
written by Keith Roberts - Randy Woolford
performed by The Young Dubliners

Madigan Men is produced by Chupack Productions / Touchstone Television, in association with Artists Television Group
