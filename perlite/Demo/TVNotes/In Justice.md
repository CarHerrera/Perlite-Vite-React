 Jason O'Mara said. "In Justice isn't a procedural, In Justice isn't a character drama, it isn't a law show, it isn't a cop show.  But it's all of those."  That is the best way to describe In Justice. 
In Justice has a different spin, instead of putting people in jail, they go out and free the wrongly convicted.
Kyle MacLachalan plays David Swain, the head of the National Justice Project.  No one knows for sure his true motives  for starting this organization, possibly for political reasons. Jason O'Mara is his partner  Charles Conti, an ex-cop who handles the investigations. Despite being opposites these two respect each other and work well together.  The rest of the team consists of Constance Zimmer as Brianna, Daniel Cosgrove as Jon and Marisol Nichols as Sonya.
