Also known as Traffic: The Miniseries, this three-part USA original is loosely based on both Steven Soderbergh's 2000 theatrical feature as well as the British miniseries (Traffik) that inspired it. The miniseries features three overlapping plots about illegal drug, weapons, and human trafficking, with an ensemble cast that includes Cliff Curtis, Martin Donovan, Balthazar Getty, Elias Koteas, and Mary McCormack.
