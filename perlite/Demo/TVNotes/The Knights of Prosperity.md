In this comedy from ABC, Eugene Gurkin (Donal Logue) spent years dreaming of quitting his graveyard janitorial job and opening a bar. But like a lot of people, he doesn't have enough money to make his dreams come true. So one night after watching an episode of "E! News", Eugene recruits a group of misfits to help him to carry out a plot to rob the plush celebrity apartment inhabited by Mick Jagger. When a team as special as that one is recruited, some funny things can happen.
