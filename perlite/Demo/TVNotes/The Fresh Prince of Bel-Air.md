A wealthy family living in Bel-Air, California, receives a dubious gift from their poorer relations in Philadelphia when Grammy Award-winner Will Smith arrives as The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. His mother wants him to learn some good old-fashioned values from his successful relatives. But Will shatters the sophisticated serenity of Bel-Air with his streetwise common sense, much to the dismay of his upper-crust uncle, Philip Banks (James Avery), Aunt Vivian (Janet Hubert-Whitten and Daphne Maxwell Reid) and three conceited cousins, Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), Hilary (Karyn Parsons) and Ashley (Tatyana Ali) - and even the butler, Geoffrey (Joseph Marcell). As the Banks family opens their home - and their checkbook - to their needy relative, Will adapts easily to their indulgent lifestyle. Yet, he reminds everyone that the simplest pleasures of family life can't be bought at any price.Repeats can be seen on Nick at Nite, The N (Noggin's nightime program lineup), and weekday afternoons on TBS.Nielsen Ratings

Now this is the story all about how My life got flipped, turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground where I spent most of my days Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool And shootin' some B-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighbourhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said "you're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air" I whistled for a cab and when it came near the License plate said "Fresh" and had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to bel-air I pulled up to a house about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes, smell you later Looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
