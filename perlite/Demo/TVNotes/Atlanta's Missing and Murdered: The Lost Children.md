The five-part documentary series looks into the cases of kidnapping and murder of at least 30 African-American children, aged 7 to 17, in Atlanta between 1979 and 1981 that were recently reopened by the Atlanta Police Department in 2019 (and dramatized in the second season of Netflix's Mindhunter).
