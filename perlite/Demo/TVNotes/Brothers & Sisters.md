The adult siblings -- Sarah Walker (formerly Whedon), Tommy Walker, Kevin Walker, Justin Walker, and Kitty Walker -- try to live up to their parents' expectations. Alongside their mother Nora Holden, Nora's brother Saul Holden, Sarah's husband (now ex-husband) Joe Whedon, Tommy's wife Julia Walker, Kevin's husband Scotty Wandell and mysterious Holly Harper.
