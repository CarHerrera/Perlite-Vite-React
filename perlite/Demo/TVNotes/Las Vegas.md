This fast-paced, sexy drama follows the elite Las Vegas surveillance team charged with maintaining the security of one of "Sin City's" largest resorts and casinos. Oscar and Golden Globe Award nominee James Caan ("The Godfather", "Misery") stars as Big Ed Deline, the head of the surveillance team for the Montecito Resort & Casino.

With his protégé, Danny McCoy (Josh Duhamel, "All My Children") an ex-U.S. Marine and Las Vegas native, they deal with card-counting cheaters, costly streaks of random luck and rival casinos stealing their big-money players. If the typical job-related pressures weren't enough, Big Ed recently found Danny in bed with his only daughter, Delinda (Molly Sims, MTV's "House of Style"). Rounding out this cast of high rollers is Danny McCoy's longtime, savvy friend -- and soon to be director of special events -- Mary Connell (Nikki Cox, "Nikki"), the all-knowing valet Mike Cannon (James Lesure, "For Your Love"), sleek pit boss Nessa Holt a.k.a. "The Ice Queen" (Marsha Thomason, "Black Knight") and elusive former competitor Samantha "Sam" Jane (Vanessa Marcil, "Beverly Hills, 90210").
