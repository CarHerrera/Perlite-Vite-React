Hannah is more than she appears to be in Secret Diary of a Call Girl.  Hannah is also Belle, one of the top high class call girls in the city of London.  Hannah and Belle have the same common goal; to make as much money as possible while they still can.

This show was originally shown by ITV2 in the UK (season one from September 27th 2007 till November 15th 2007). This first season was a huge success for ITV2 with up to two million viewers per episode.

Early in 2008, US network Showtime was attracted by the show's success and bought the license to show two seasons in the US (20 episodes). The broadcast is scheduled to start on June 16th 2008.

The second season will air on ITV2 starting September 11th 2008.

More to the shows success:
The controversial sex scenes also resulted in a nomination for best soft core production at the "UK Adult Film Awards" in 2007.
But that's not all! The first season has also been nominated for the "Golden Rose TV award" in the category "best drama".

Only weeks after the first series ended, ITV announced a second series, and production started in early 2008.
