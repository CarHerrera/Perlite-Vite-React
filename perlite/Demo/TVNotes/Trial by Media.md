The six-part documentary series looks into the impact media coverage may have had on high profile cases including the murder of Scott Amedure, who was on The Jenny Jones Show; federal corruption charges against ex-Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, and the death of an unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo, who was shot 41 times by the NYPD.
