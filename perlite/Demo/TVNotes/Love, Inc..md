Love, Inc. is about a group of savvy matchmakers who work at a full-service dating consulting firm.  They help lovelorn single men and women present the best image possible to just the right prospects, all while trying to handle their own love lives and entanglements.

The energetic staff of this "hook up" agency takes pride in their success as full service dating consultants.  Leading this thriving team is the owner and founder of Love, Inc., Clea (Holly Robinson Peete, "For Your Love" & "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper").  After her marriage of nine years falls apart, she now finds herself forced into the dating world once again.  

Denise Johnson (Busy Philipps, "Dawson's Creek") is an energetic, practical, young woman who helps Clea make the company a huge success; she is skilled at helping her clients obtain their seemingly impossible soulmates, yet struggles with her own failure to find true love.

Making the hip, busy offices run smoothly is Francine (Reagan Gomez-Preston, "The Parent 'Hood"), who in addition to being an excellent wingwoman, has a great sense of fashion and encourages her clients to trust it.  Rounding out the Love, Inc. staff are Viviana (Ion Overman), a quick-witted, sharp-tounged receptionist, and Barry (Vince Vieluf), a wingman whose quirky comments always astonish everyone.

These modern day wingmen & wingwomen work day and night in their field, whether it be at a club or restaurant, bringing desperately seeking strangers together in order to form wonderful relationships.  Personally, they continue a personal journey to find their own special love, whether it is by simple compatibility or chance

NOTE: Every episode of the series is named after another TV show, all situation comedies.
