In Miami, FBI agent Phil Rask (Martin Freeman) has been investigating Nick Talman's (Adam Brody) father, who asks his son to hide the dirty money. Nick invests the cash in a digital currency start up run Izzy Morales (Otmara Marrero), which also brings the interest of Ronald Dacey (Edi Gathegi), a local Haitian gang leader.
