This half-hour comedy chronicles the hilarious world of Christopher Titus and his totally messed-up poor white trash family. Between his drunken father, his dimwitted brother, and his goody-goody best friend, it's amazing Titus is alive, let alone  engaged to a "normal" girl.

Titus adapted Christopher Titus' stand-up routine in a novel way: each episode is narrated by Titus from a black & white "Neutral Space," from which he comments on the events as they unfold, punctuated by short, surreal flashbacks to his childhood and adolescence. The hilarious interplay between these three levels of narrative is sometimes amazingly complex and even contradictory, highlighting the exceedingly black nature of the show's humor. Alas, the Fox network lived up to its history of commissioning innovative television and then sabotaging it; the third and blackest season was made particularly incoherent by showing the sequences out of logical order.

Titus never made it to syndication, and is currently unavailable — a buried gem — until its release on DVD in September 2005.
