Who’s hot? Who’s not? The popular ones, the unpopular ones, the jocks, the geeks. Kennedy High is the set for a big war: the popular against the unpopular. This is the concept behind the 99-01 teen television series Popular.

On the popular side: Brooke McQueen, a gorgeous blonde, and  the head cheerleader; backed up by her best friend Nicole, the Devil in person; as well as her boyfriend, Josh Ford, star of the football team; Mary Cherry, the psychotic multi-millionaire Texan girl; and Sugar Daddy, the heavy-set wannbe gangsta and football player.

On the unpopular side: Sam McPherson, the smart girl who is always looking to expose injustice; Harrison, the geek with a crush on the head cheerleader; Carmen Ferrara, the heavy girl with the warm heart; and Lily, the confused activist girl with the boyish look.

Brooke and Sam, enemies by nature, must deal with their parents’ marriage to each other and their high school rivalry.
