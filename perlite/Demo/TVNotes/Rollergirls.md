Meet the fearless females of Rollergirls.  Lux, Sister Mary Jane, Punky Bruiser, Miss Conduct, Venis Envy, Cha Cha, and the rest of the gang play tough in their quest for victory.  Traveling at high speeds around the banked track, these girls don’t let anything get in the way of a win for their team.

Out of the rink, these rough girls lead very different lives.  Their jobs range from maternity nurse to special education teacher.  The allure of the sport for them is in the excitement and the thrill of adventure.
