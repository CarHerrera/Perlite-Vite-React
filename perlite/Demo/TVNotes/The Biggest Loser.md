The biggest winner is "The Biggest Loser" in this compelling new weight-loss reality drama in which two celebrity fitness trainers join with top health experts to help overweight contestants transform their bodies, health and ultimately, their lives. Alison Sweeney ("Days of Our Lives") hosts the unscripted, two-hour series in which two competing teams follow comprehensive diet and exercise plans to undergo radical physical makeovers. Unique physical challenges, surprising alliances and irresistible temptations make the competition even tougher for the contestants, who ultimately have to decide which player gets eliminated each week. In the end, "The Biggest Loser" becomes the biggest winner, walking away with a healthier body - and $250,000. "The Biggest Loser" is a production of NBC Universal Television Studio, Reveille, 25/7 Productions and 3 Ball Productions. Ben Silverman (NBC's "The Restaurant," "The Office (US)"), David Broome ("Jingle Ball Rock"), J.D. Roth ("NBC's "For Love or Money," "Endurance"), John Foy ("For Love or Money," "Endurance") and Todd A. Nelson ("For Love or Money," "Endurance") are the executive producers.

After the first Biggest Loser was crowned in January of 2005, a second Biggest Loser began in September, pitting the men versus the women in the ultimate chance of losing weight and feeling good about yourself. With the success of the second season, a special edition version of six episodes started in January 2006, with a third season starting in March 2006. Final Weight Loss of Season One Contestants:
