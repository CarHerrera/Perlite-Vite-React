During World War II, a small English regional theatre is hosting  a touring production of Shakespeare's King Lear. An hour before the show, actor/manager Sir (Anthony Hopkins) who is playing Lear, is missing and it is up to his dresser Norman (Ian McKellen) to keep the show going in this adaptation of Ronald Harwood's play.
