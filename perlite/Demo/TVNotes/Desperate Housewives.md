About ten years ago on a sunny day in the loveliest of suburbs, in a town called Fairview, housewife Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) decided to end it all. Now she takes us into the lives of her friends, family and neighbors... Her circle of girlfriends on Wisteria Lane includes Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher), a known klutz who recently remarried the love of her life; Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), who struggles with her family and career; Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross), the owner of a thriving catering business and a successful cookbook author, whose lovelife is very complicated nowadays; the ex-model turned housewife Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria Parker), who finds herself chasing after two daughters plus a wild niece. The ladies have welcomed the now single Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany), who lived on the street once before when Mary Alice was alive, into their small, tight-knit group, and the newest housewife to arrive on the lane, Angie Bolen (Drea de Matteo), promises to shake things up quite a bit.Then there are the men: Mike Delfino (James Denton), Susan's husband, a charming plumber; Lynette's adorable husband, Tom (Doug Savant), who always stays by his wife's side despite many challenges; Gabrielle's husband, Carlos (Ricardo Antonio Chavira), who works hard to provide for his wife and daughters; Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), a devoted husband to Bree; and Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling), Angie's creepy and secretive husband. The kids include Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Susan's polite and charming daughter, who is now keeping some secrets of her own; Porter Scavo (Charlie Carver), one of Lynette and Tom's twins, an emotional rebel; Parker (Joshua Logan Moore) and Penny (Kendall Applegate), the Scavos' younger children; MJ Delfino (Mason Vale Cotton), Susan and Mike's cute young boy; Juanita (Madison De La Garza) and Celia (Daniella Baltodano), the Solises' young, mischievous daughters; Ana Solis (Maiara Walsh), Carlos' manipulative and spoiled niece; and Danny Bolen (Beau Mirchoff), Angie's strange and moody 19-year-old son.

And finally there are the gay couple, Bob (Tuc Watkins) and Lee (Kevin Rahm), who moved from the city for a more quieter, peaceful life, and local busybody Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten).From her unique vantage point, Mary Alice sees more now than she ever did alive, and she's planning to share all the delicious secrets that hide behind every neighbor's closed door in this seemingly perfect American suburb."Desperate Housewives" stars Brenda Strong as Mary Alice Young, Teri Hatcher as Susan Mayer, Felicity Huffman as Lynette Scavo, Marcia Cross as Bree Hodge, Eva Longoria Parker as Gabrielle Solis, Dana Delany as Katherine Mayfair (season 4 onwards), Nicollette Sheridan as Edie Britt (seasons 1-5), Drea de Matteo as Angie Bolen (season 6), Alfre Woodard as Betty Applewhite (season 2), James Denton as Mike Delfino, Ricardo Antonio Chavira as Carlos Solis, Doug Savant as Tom Scavo, Kyle MacLachlan as Orson Hodge (season 3 onwards), Andrea Bowen as Julie Mayer, Shawn Pyfrom as Andrew Van de Kamp, Joy Lauren as Danielle Van de Kamp, Mark Moses as Paul Young and Cody Kasch as Zach Young (seasons 1-2), Steven Culp as Rex Van de Kamp (season 1), Jesse Metcalfe as John Rowland (season 1 - recurring afterwards), Roger Bart as George Williams (seasons 1-2), Richard Burgi as Karl Mayer (season 2 - recurring otherwise), Mehcad Brooks as Matthew Applewhite (season 2), Josh Henderson as Austin McCann and Dougray Scott as Ian Hainsworth (season 3), Rachel Fox as Kayla Huntington (seasons 3-4), Lyndsy Fonseca as Dylan Mayfair (season 4), Neal McDonough as Dave Williams (season 5), Maiara Walsh as Ana Solis (season 6), Jeffrey Nordling as Nick Bolen and Beau Mirchoff as Danny Bolen (season 6) and Kathryn Joosten as Karen McCluskey.
