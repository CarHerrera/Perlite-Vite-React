"Reunion" is an original concept in television that follows six close friends from their high school graduation in 1986 to their twentieth high school reunion in 2006. Each episode covers a year in their lives. It's a murder-mystery that promises stories of love and loss, marriage and death, triumph and scandal as it depicts both the hopes and dreams of 18-year-olds as well as the realities that mark those lives two decades later.
The show was supposed to have 21 episodes, but it was canceled in the middle, having only 13 episodes, so the show never had an ending and the killer's identity was never revealed
