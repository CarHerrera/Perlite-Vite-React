With the success of The CW's incarnation of 90210, producers Darren Swimmer and Todd Slavin (Smallville) re-imagine a new tale from the popular primetime soap Melrose Place.

The new Melrose Place follows the lives of residents in the iconic apartment complex, who pursue their dreams at any cost.

Maybe It's Me's Shaun Sipos and Harper's Island's Katie Cassidy play the lead roles in the primetime soap. Sipos plays bad boy David and Cassidy plays bisexual publicist Ella.

Greek's Michael Rady, 90210's Jessica Lucas, All My Children's Colin Egglesfield, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles' Stephanie Jacobsen, and singing sensation Ashlee Simpson-Wentz round out the cast of the new Melrose Place.

Melrose Place alumni Laura Leighton, Thomas Calabro, Josie Bissett and Daphne Zuniga reprise their roles as Sydney Andrews, Dr. Michael Mancini, Jane Mancini and Jo Reynolds.

Melrose Place is produced by CBS Paramount Network Television.
