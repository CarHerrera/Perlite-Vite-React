Independent spy agency Citadel was destroyed by crime syndicate Manticore and agents Mason Kane (Richard Madden) and Nadia Sinh (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) had their memories wiped. Eight years later, ex-colleague Bernard Orlick (Stanley Tucci) tracks them down, seeking help to stop Manticore in this espionage series from Anthony and Joe Russo.
