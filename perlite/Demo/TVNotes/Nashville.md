This new "docu-soap" follows a group of people as they try to make it big in Nashville's music and social scenes. Participants include Jamey Johnson, Matt Jenkins, Lindsey Hager, Jeff Allen, Clint Moseley, Chuck Wicks, Rachel Bradshaw, Mika Combs, and Sarah Gunsolus.

After only two episodes the show got pulled from the weekly schedule, but set to return on November 9th 2007, but even before that happened FOX pulled the plug once and for all canceling the show and taking the show off for ever. It remains unknown how many episodes were produced in the first place.
