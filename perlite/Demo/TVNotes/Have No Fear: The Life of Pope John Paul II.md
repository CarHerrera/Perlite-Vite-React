This film portrays the life of Pope John Paul II over sixty years.

Born in 1920 in Wadowice, Poland, Karol "Lolek" Wojtyla would become the man ordained as a priest in 1946, then become the youngest Bishop in Poland at age 38, and soon Archbishop, then Cardinal and finally Pope, the first ever from Poland and the youngest appointed in over 100 years.

Viewers will witness this man's life throughout the years, from the loss of his family before he was an adult to the loss of his Jewish friends during WWII. From his career as a priest, where he would impress his superiors with his intellect, to his career as Pope where he would champion causes thought to be liberal and conservative.
