From the creator of Deadwood comes this new "surf noir" drama about a dysfunctional Southern California family galvanized by the sudden arrival of two strangers: a man out for revenge and a boy looking for surfing lessons. In Imperial Beach, California, the dysfunctional Yost family intersects with two new arrivals to the community: a dim-but-wealthy surfing enthusiast and man spurned by the Yosts years ago.
