Peta Wilson stars as Nikita, a young woman framed for murder and faced with life imprisonment, until an ultimatum arises which involves working for a clandestine anti-terrorism organization known as Section One. Nikita chooses a life of espionage, but soon discovers that she is just the latest pawn in Section's games...La Femme Nikita was broadcast on USA Network, and produced by Baton, CTV Television Network, Fireworks Entertainment and LPN Productions. The series ran for four seasons before being canceled, until a fan campaign successfully brought it back for one final run of new episodes in 2001.
