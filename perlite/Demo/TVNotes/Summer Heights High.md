Summer Heights High is the outrageously funny high school comedy created and written by Chris Lilley, creator of We Can Be Heroes. The mockumentary series documents the ups and downs of three different characters, all played by Lilley, over one school term at Summer Heights High - Jonah, a 13 year old delinquent breakdancer from Tonga; Mr G, and ego-driven Drama teacher with delusional showbiz dreams; and Ja'mie, a stuck up private schoolgirl on a student exchange. Summer Heights High has won two Australian Film Institute Awards and two Logie Awards.
