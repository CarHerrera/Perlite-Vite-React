When Steve McGarrett's father is murdered, he decided to return home to Oahu in order to catch the killer. The governor offers him the opportunity to run a new task force where he is able to call the shots. Detective Steve McGarrett brings together his own team, beginning with Chin Ho Kelly; an ex-Honolulu Police Detective and former protégé of McGarrett's father. Kelly has been assigned to a federal security patrol after being suspected of corruption. Detective Danny "Danno" Williams is a New Jersey cop who recently moved to the island and is raising his 8-year-old daughter.  Kono Kalakaua is Kelly's cousin and a rookie officer, fresh from the academy. McGarrett's team is giving full backing from the governor and plays only by their own rules.
