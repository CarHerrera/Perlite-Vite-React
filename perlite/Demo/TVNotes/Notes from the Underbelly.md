People are going to get suspicious when Lauren suddenly switches to decaf, suddenly stops drinking at cocktail parties, and starts going to the obgyn...a lot. They are both about to learn that the politics of parenthood can be just as demanding as raising a child.They're going to have to deal with theirs, competitives, but well-meanings, friends' strange "advice" about their relationship. Are they both ables to resist that pressure and create a family?
