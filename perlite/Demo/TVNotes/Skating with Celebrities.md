If you thought Dancing with the Stars was entertaining, just take a look at Skating with Celebrities, FOX's new reality competition which pits six professional figure skaters with six celebrities, whom have little to no skill in the sport.  Serving as host is Olympic gold medalist and world champion figure skater Scott Hamilton.  The celebrity/professional pairings are:
1) Comedian Dave Coulier ("Full House") and two-time Olympic medal winner Nancy Kerrigan.
2) Olympic decathlon gold medalist Bruce Jenner and world champion pairs figure skater Tai Babilonia.
3) Actor Todd Bridges ("Different Strokes") with three-time U.S. national pairs figure skating champion Jenni Meno.
4) Actress Kristy Swanson ("Buffy the Vampire Slayer") and two-time Olympic pairs figure skating medalist and world champion Lloyd Eisler.
5) Singer/songwriter Deborah Gibson with four-time world figure skating champion Kurt Browning.
6) television personality/reporter Jillian Barberie ("Good Day LA") with three-time U.S. pairs champion and world figure skating champion John Zimmerman.The pairs must face the challenge of learning new routines that test their artistic and athletic abilities.  The pressure is on as the teams compete in front of a panel of judges including Olympic gold medalist and world figure skating champion Dorothy Hamill.  Lending their choreography expertise are five-time U.S. National ice dance champion and Emmy Award-winning choreographer Michael Seibert, U.S. and world figure skating champion and director/choreographer Randy Gardner and three-time U.S. ice dance champion Renee Roca.
