The King of Queens revolves around Doug Heffernan Kevin James, Everybody Loves Raymond), a Queens, N.Y., parcel delivery man with simple desires. Among his prized possessions is a 70-inch television that his lovely wife, Carrie (Leah Remini, Fired Up), provided for him. However, now that Carrie's widowed father, Arthur (Jerry Stiller, Seinfeld), lives with them, Doug's television room has become Arthur's bedroom. Doug and his sports-watching buddies, Spence (Patton Oswalt, Crank Yankers) and Deacon (Victor Williams, The Animatrix)--and the beloved television--have been relegated to the garage, and Doug now shares his castle with a very eccentric father-in-law and his very unusual habits.Theme Song
"My eyes are gettin' weary,
My back is gettin' tight,
I'm sittin' here in traffic,
On the Queensborough bridge tonight,
But I don't care cuz all I wanna do,
Is cash my check and drive right home to you,
Cuz baby all my life I will be driving home to you."
