Spectacle: Elvis Costello With... fuses the best elements of talk radio and music television, inviting viewers to enjoy rare musical performances and intimate conversations between the award-winning host and his iconic guests - each of whom is an influential figure from the world of music, politics or film. Explaining his approach, Elvis said, "I'm not interested in extracting some dark secret. I'd rather hear about a bright secret, a deep love or a curiosity that might be otherwise obscured by fame. This is a wonderful opportunity to talk in complete thoughts about music, movies, art or even vaudeville - then frame it with unique and illustrative performances."

Guest artists, who run the gamut from legendary performers to notable newcomers, demonstrate the development and creation of their music - often by playing new, stripped-down, acoustic, impromptu or solo versions of some of their best and most popular songs. Elvis and The Imposters perform interpretations of songs either by or associated with the featured guests. In addition, the show features extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime musical collaborations.

Spectacle airs on the Sundance Channel in the U.S., Channel 4 in the U.K. and CTV & Bravo in Canada. Elsewhere, FremantleMedia distributes the show worldwide. In addition, Season 1 of Spectacle is now available on iTunes and a DVD/Blu-ray box set was released throughout North America on November 17, 2009. The show is recorded before a live audience at Harlem's world famous Apollo Theater in New York City and Toronto's historic Masonic Temple.
