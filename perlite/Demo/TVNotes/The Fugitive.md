"Updating the classic 1960's action series The Fugitive (1963) with the thrills and high-tech style of the 1993 Oscar-winning hit movie, "The Fugitive" returns to television with the riveting tale of Dr. Richard Kimble (Tim Daly), an innocent man accused of murdering his beloved wife. Adrift in a sea of strangers in strange locations, Kimble, on the hunt for the one-armed man who actually committed the crime, desperately tries to avoid being captured by Lt. Philip Gerard (Mykelti Williamson, "The New WKRP in Cincinnati"), who always seems to be only two steps behind. From week to week, Kimble searches city after city for the elusive killer whose capture would finally allow him to prove his innocence and return to his former life. In constant flight in his quest for justice, Kimble touches many lives, but the encounters are ended as suddenly as they have begun when the fugitive is forced to escape to yet another city." - CBS press release.

CBS premiered the much-hyped new action series on its Friday night lineup, which included fellow action series "Nash Bridges" and newcomer "CSI." Many predicted the new version of "The Fugitive" would become one of CBS's greatest hits, but the show only earned decent ratings for its first episode (curiously, everybody thought "CSI" was too morbid and wouldn't live to see a pickup, and it turned out to be the big hit "The Fugitive" was supposed to be). From then on ratings fell to an underexpected average, and eventually CBS decided to revitalize its Thursday nights with ratings magnet "CSI," bumping Dick Van Dyke's "Diagnosis Murder" to Fridays, where it took "The Fugitive"'s old time slot. Even with a good lead-in the ratings didn't rise (the show aired opposite "Who Wants to be a Millionaire," which at the time drew huge numbers, giving the show a push to death). At the end of the season, CBS decided to cancel the entire lineup. At least they had the decency to show the series finale - but not to tell the producers not to write in a cliffhanger.
