This sequel to the 1994 feature film Stargate chronicles the further adventures of planet-hopping Stargate Command (SGC) beginning a year after events in the movie. Though SG-1 was canceled by Showtime after its fifth season, production continued, with new episodes airing on the Sci Fi Channel (Syfy) for another five seasons, making it American television's longest-running science fiction series to date. The cast was led by MacGyver's Richard Dean Anderson for much of its run.
