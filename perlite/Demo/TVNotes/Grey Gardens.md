Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, "Little Edie," were the toast of high society in the 1930s, lavishly and vivaciously entertaining their friends. By the 1960s a turn in fortunes had changed everything, and the two women adopted a reclusive and eccentric lifestyle. When two documentary filmmakers arrive at their doorstep in 1973, the women make a fateful decision to open their lives, transforming these relatives of Jackie Kennedy Onassis into cult icons.

Inspired by the original documentary, and covering four decades, this HBO film takes a closer look at where the ladies came from, why their lives turned destitute and how the film affected their future.

An HBO Films production with Specialty Films and Locomotive, starring Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange.
