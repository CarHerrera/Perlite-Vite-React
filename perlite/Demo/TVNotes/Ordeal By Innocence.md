Rachel Argyll (Anna Chancellor) is murdered and her adopted son Jack (Anthony Boyle) is sent to prison for the crime. 18 months later, just as Rachel's husband Leo Argyll (Bill Nighy) is about to marry his secretary, Gwenda Vaughan (Alice Eve), a man (Luke Treadaway) arrives saying he has an alibi for Jack in this latest adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1958 novel.
