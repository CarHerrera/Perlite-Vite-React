Molly Anne Caffrey (Carla Gugino) is a government contingency agent whose job is to create response plans for any possible worse-case scenario. One of her plans - THRESHOLD - is enacted by J.T. Baylock when the U.S. Navy realizes an "extra terrestrial craft" has landed in the mid-Atlantic ocean. Caffrey must hand-select a team of scientists - consisting of Dr. Nigel Fenway (Brent Spiner) - a NASA microbiologist, Lucas Pegg (Rob Benedict) - a neurotic physicist, Arthur Ramsey (Peter Dinklage) - an expert linguist and mathematician, and Sean Cavennaugh (Brian Van Holt) - a highly trained covert operative with a puzzling past. Threshold stems from the minds of producers David Heyman, David Goyer, and Brannon Braga.
