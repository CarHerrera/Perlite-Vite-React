Contestants vie to see who really knows all the lyrics to those popular songs that are constantly stuck in our heads. The house band starts the song and would then stop at a certain point in order for a contestant to sing the rest of the song verse. Miss a word and you're out; nail the song and you win big!

The show ended on NBC, but in the Summer of 2009, was picked up on CMT (a sister network of NBC). The new CMT version blends a mix of 60 percent country music with 40 percent popular favorites from other genres.
