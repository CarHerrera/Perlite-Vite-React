More than just a show to review new cars, Top Gear is essential viewing. Not just for petrol heads, it also has a huge following amongst people with little or no interest in cars - both male and female. This is due to the show's irreverent approach to motoring, the humour and the priceless chemistry between the show's presenters. A global audience of 350 million can't be wrong.
