"Conviction", a new legal drama from Dick Wolf (‘Law & Order’-brand series), focuses on young assistant district attorneys in New York as they struggle with a demanding case load that challenges their lack of experience. Although this is not a spin-off of any "Law & Order" show, this show still takes place in that universe, proven by Stephanie March returning as ADA Bureau Chief Cabot from "Law & Order: SVU".
