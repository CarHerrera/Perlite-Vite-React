'Til Death is a comedy about the triumphs and tribulations of marriage and friendship from very different perspectives. It's about the funny – and sometimes annoying – things that happen between husbands, wives, parents, children, neighbors and friends day after day after day...

EDDIE (Brad Garrett) and JOY STARK (Joely Fisher) are your typical long-time married couple: Eddie is the unemotional, cynical and tell-it-like-it-is husband while Joy is the caring, loving wife who on a daily basis has to put up with all things Eddie. You could say Joy is the yin to Eddie's yang. They've been through it all together – and actually survived. Joy and Eddie are the perfect fit, and as much as they gripe about their marriage, Eddie really does love Joy, and Joy, despite it all, loves Eddie for all his shortcomings.

Living in suburban Philadelphia, Eddie and Joy live somewhat idyllic lives. Eddie is a high school history teacher, and Joy works at a local travel agency. Their daughter, ALLY (Lindsey Broad), is in a long-term relationship with DOUG (Timm Sharp), whom Eddie and Joy consider unworthy of their princess. This season, Ally and Doug return from their trek in the Ecuadorian rainforest and set up camp in the Starks' backyard. Meanwhile, Eddie decides to write a book about the Hindenburg, and Joy comes to terms with the job market in the current economy.
