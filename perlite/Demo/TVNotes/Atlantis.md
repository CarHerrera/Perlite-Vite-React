More than two millennia ago, Plato wrote about the legendary island of Atlantis, its rise and downfall. This show, produced by BBC and the same team who worked on another hit, Merlin, mixes fantasy and adventure. It follows the young Greek hero Jason as he arrives on the mysterious island of Atlantis. There, he encounters new friends and foes, magic and monsters.
