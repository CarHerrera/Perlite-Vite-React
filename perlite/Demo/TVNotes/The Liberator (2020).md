The four-part World War II animated series (using new patent-pending Trioscope Enhanced Hybrid Animation technology) is based on Alex Kershaw's 2013 book of the same name about U.S. Army officer Felix Sparks and the 157th Infantry Regiment from Oklahoma that included cowboys, Native Americans and Mexican-Americans as they invaded Italy  and freed those at the Dachau concentration camp.
