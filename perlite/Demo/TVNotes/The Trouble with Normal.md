The Trouble with Normal follows the lives of four men and their therapist as they try to face the fears of the world while living in crazy New York. Bob, the most normal one, is just trying to get some help with how to handle his personal life. Zack is Bob's new neighbor who thinks he is constantly being watched and that the world is after him. Stansfield is a very insecure mailman who finds himself constantly wanting to please people. Max is the shyest of them all, but all he really wants is a friendly shoulder to rely on. Claire, their therapist, tries to not be driven crazy with this group. She is supposed to be their advisor, but most of the time she is the one who is advised as the guys keep nosing themselves into her life.

The show's original name was "People Who Fear People," but it was changed just a few weeks before its premiere.
