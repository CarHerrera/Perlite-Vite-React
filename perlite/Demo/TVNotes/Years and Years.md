Spanning 15 years, Vivienne Rook (Emma Thompson) rises from vocal celebrity to controversial MP. The effect of her policies to British society are reflected in an ordinary Manchester family that includes Daniel (Russell Tovey), Stephen (Rory Kinnear) and his wife Celeste (T’Nia Miller), sisters Rosie (Ruth Madeley) and Edith (Jessica Hynes), and Gran Muriel (Anne Reid) in this six-part mini-series created by Russell T. Davies.
