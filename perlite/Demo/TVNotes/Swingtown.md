This new period drama takes viewers back to the 1970s for a look at suburban households testing the murky waters of sexual revolution, following swingers throughout open marriages, "key parties" and other swingers extravaganzas.

Mike Kelley is creator and executive producer of the pilot, produced by CBS Paramount Network Television.

The show originally aired on Thursday evenings, but after episode 7 it moved to Fridays, swapping with Flashpoint.
