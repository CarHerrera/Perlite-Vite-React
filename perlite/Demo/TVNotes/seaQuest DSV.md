In the year 2018, mankind is colonizing the oceans and exploiting their resources, establishing small undersea farming, mining, and manufacturing communities. But with the newfound potential comes old-fashioned conflict and the United Earth Oceans Organization (U.E.O.) assigns the submarine, seaQuest, DSV, led by Captain Nathan Bridger to keep the underwater peace and generally patrol the planet's final frontier. Amongst the crew is a teenage genius, Lucas Wolenczak, and Darwin, the intelligent dolphin, who thanks to Lucas's inventions can understand human speech and whose speech can be translated in to English. In the show's third season, the crew was thrust forward ten years prompting the show's title to change to seaQuest, 2032. A new captain, Oliver Hudson was at the helm as Captain Nathan Bridger retired. FILMING LOCATION:seaQuest was filmed on location in Los Angeles, California, USA for the first season and in Orlando, Florida, USA for the second and third seasons.
