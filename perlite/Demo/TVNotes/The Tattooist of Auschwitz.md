In 1942 Auschwitz, new prisoner Lali (Jonah Hauer-King) was put in charge of tattooing ID numbers and fell in love with fellow prisoner Gita (Anna Próchniak). 60 years later, widower Lali (Harvey Keitel) tells his story to writer Heather Morris (Melanie Lynskey) in this limited series inspired by real events.
