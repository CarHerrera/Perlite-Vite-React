Working Girl is another hit movie that failed as a tv series. The 1988 film starred Melanie Griffith in the title role, with Sigourney Weaver as her insufferable boss, but the tv series had to settle for more lesser known talent. Tess, the spunky, independent secretary portrayed here by newcomer "Sandra Bullock" who suddenly becomes a junior executive after charming company owner A.J. Trask. Tess' first challenge was to survive working with her antagonistic, uptight immediate boss, Mrs. Newhouse, also known as the "company witch". Lana, a secretary, was Tess' best pal, more interested in doing her nails and rooting for Tess than in getting ahead herself; Everett was a fellow junior executive  who was charming but eager to please; and Libby was Tess' world-wise, "permanent temporary" secretary, a moonlighting musician. Back home each night on Staten Island, Tess had to contend with her doting parents Joe and Fran, and with Sal, the blue-collar neighborhood Romeo who constantly pursued her.
