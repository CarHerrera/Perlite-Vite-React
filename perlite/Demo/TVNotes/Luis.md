Luis is living the American dream. He's the proud owner of a Spanish Harlem donut shop and the landlord of the building it's in. But a dream is only a dream, and you've got to wake up sometime. He wakes up every day ... to a cast of characters that includes an obnoxious elderly Irish woman who lives in a rent-controlled apartment; a Chinese delivery boy who swears he was a cardiologist back in the "Old Country" and doesn't speak English because "This is America – you speak Spanish"; and to TK a young African-American kid who harasses his customers by trying to sell them "merchandise" he found in Luis' dumpster. Luis' family doesn't help much. His ex-wife, Isabella, constantly reminds him why they got divorced, but somehow she can't get enough of him or his donuts. Their daughter, Marly, is responsible and hardworking but lives in Luis' building with her free-loading boyfriend Greg, a pretentious "artiste" who hopes to pay his share of the rent by selling his paintings. At least Luis has Ginger – his mint, '82 Olds Delta 88, and his trusted assistant Richie, who pines for Luis' daughter. Luis is not quite conservative, not quite liberal. He's a man who's got the world figured out – the world just doesn't know it yet.
