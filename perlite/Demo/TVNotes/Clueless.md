Based on the 1995 hit film of the same name, Clueless is a popular half-hour American sitcom. The show aired for three seasons between 1996 and 1999. Clueless began life as part of ABC's popular 'TGIF' strand, but after it had finished it's first run, the network decided to cancel the series. It was a decision they would later regret, when it's re-runs proved a huge ratings winner, even competing with the incredibly successful Sabrina The Teenage Witch. Rival network UPN promptly capitalized on ABC's mistake, and the series found a new home where it aired for two further seasons. In a change to the movie, Rachel Blanchard plays the well natured and complicated, yet, as the shows title suggests, clueless teen soul Cher Horowitz. But many of the movie's cast return to reprise their characters, including Stacey Dash as Cher's sexy, confident and sassy friend Dionne Davenport. Set in the wealthiest parts of Beverley Hills, the show profiled the many loves and lives of Cher and her friends, all equally as rich, pretty and charming as her - all, that is, but the rude and self obsessed Amber Mariens (Elisa Donovan). Without her mother around, young Cher must travel through the trickiest times - those oh-so awkward teenage years - with the guidance of only her friends and father (Michael Lerner, Doug Sheehan). Joining her on her journey, are Murray Duvall (Donald Adeosun Faison) and Sean Holliday  (Sean Holland) who more often than not, find themselves getting into trouble, not doing enough to help or generally just getting it very wrong. As the show developed, and the character's developed, the writing changed. From the relaxed, confident and slow pace of the first season, to the quick, sassy, off-the-cusp and celebrity-reference filled style of the second and third seasons, enter to a new and faster style of editing for the final two seasons with some hillariously well-timed sound effects and musical scores that complimented the jokes with style. Despite all it's good points, Clueless fell victim to the UPN axe and was cancelled in 1999. But the show has now gone into syndication across the world to a brilliant response, most notably from the United Kingdom and the USA. Clueless - one of the late great teen-orientated sitcoms of the '90s.
