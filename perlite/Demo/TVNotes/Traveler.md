Jay, Tyler and Will have spent the last two years in grad school living together. They are about to spend their summer holiday traveling. But when Will gives Jay and Tyler a simple dare -- to rollerblade through one of New York's most famous museums -- it makes them prime suspects in a terrorist bombing that moments later destroys the museum. They hope that Will can prove their innocence, but discover their friend has mysteriously disappeared.
