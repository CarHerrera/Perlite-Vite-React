A riveting dramatic series based on John Grisham's novel of the same name, as well as the feature film starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones. JoBeth Williams and John Heard starred as their television counterparts (Sarandon reportedly offered Miss Williams name as her personal choice to resume the role of Reggie Love). The television series follows Reggie Love, a recovering alcoholic who has lost custody of her own two children, as she battles to win them back, meanwhile redirecting her maternal instincts through her family law practice. Reggie is continuously taking on the most hopeless of cases involving children and fights for them with a vengeance while her practice suffers financial jeopardy, as a result.
Fortunately, as she battles for her clients as well as to win her own life back, Reggie is surrounded by an equally complex and committed cast of other characters presiding over Reggie's courtroom is compassionate Judge Harry Roosevelt (Ossie Davis). Reggie's most ardent opponent and friend is District Attorney Roy Foltrigg (John Heard), her streetwise assistant is Clint (David Barry Gray) and her mother and roommate is Momma Love (Polly Holliday).
