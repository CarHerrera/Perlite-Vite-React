The First World War is over, so Sarah Burton is returning to her home in Yorkshire after helping with the war effort in London.

A modern woman, her views are foreign to those of her friends. But her passion and ambition put off men, particularly that of Robert Carne, a handsome farmer who she loves to hate.

This three-parter stars Anna Maxwell Martin and airs in February 2011 on BBC One and BBC HD.
