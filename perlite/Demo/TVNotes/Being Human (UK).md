Life among the living is tough enough, but meet Mitchell, a 120-year-old vampire, George, a highly intelligent werewolf, and Annie an agoraphobic ghost who died under mysterious circumstances, whom all live together with just the slight bit of hope that they can fit into the community and smile at the thought of being human. But they soon discover that being human is not as easy as they hoped.
