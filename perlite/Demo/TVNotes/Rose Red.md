Dr. Joyce Reardon assembles a team of paranormal talents and a gifted autistic girl to investigate an allegedly haunted mansion, known as Rose Red, built in Seattle in 1907 by oil magnate John P. Rimbauer. Can the team survive the horror that they uncover within the walls of this secretive structure? And how far will Reardon go to get the answers she seeks? This mini-series, written by Stephen King, takes you to the place that Evil calls home.
