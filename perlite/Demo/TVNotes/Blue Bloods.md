Blue Bloods is a new CBS crime drama by Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess, who are known for their work on the long running HBO drama 'The Sopranos'. The show follows the lives of the multi-generational Reagan family and their dedication to the New York City Police Department. Although being a tight-knit family, you may find that the Reagans have very different ideas of how to gain justice. But they have one thing in common: they'll stop at nothing to see justice served; because their occupation is more than just a job, it's the family business.
