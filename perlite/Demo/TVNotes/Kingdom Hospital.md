Using the Danish miniseries "Riget" (a.k.a. "The Kingdom") as a point of inspiration, master of horror Stephen King gives Kingdom Hospital a unique and menacing American touch. Kingdom is a hospital whose bizarre population includes a brilliant surgeon who lives in the basement, a nearly blind security guard and a nurse who regularly faints at the sight of blood. But when patients and staff hear the voice of a girl crying through the halls and a patient destined for life as a paraplegic miraculously recovers, they are dismissive of any suggestion of mysticism or unseen powers at their own peril.

Andrew McCarthy (plays Dr. Hook, a surgeon who lives in the hospital basement. Oscar nominee Diane Ladd (Alice) is Mrs. Druse, a hypochondriac whose psychic abilities lead her to the hospital. Fellow Oscar nominee Bruce Davison (The Practice & X-Men) will play Dr. Stegman, an arrogant, but inept physician.

The series is set up to play out like a book.  The episode you watch picks up right where the last episode left off.  Not in the sense of 24 that goes hour by hour, but more to the form of chapter by chapter.  King himself was quoted as saying "Remember that Kingdom Hospital is a "novelization for television". Like a novel, it will pay back dividends but you will have to give it a little bit of time."  King himself describes the show as a mix of ER and The Shining.
