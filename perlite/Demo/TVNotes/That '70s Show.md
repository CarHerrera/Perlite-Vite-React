Set in the era of Led Zeppelin 8-tracks, Tab cola and Farrah Fawcett posters, THAT '70s SHOW returns for an eighth season as it continues to flash back to the "Me Decade." With changes in their lives and adjustments being made, the gang from Point Place is moving onward and upward in season eight of THAT '70s SHOW. While the kids continue to make the sometimes bumpy and often hilarious transition into adulthood, the parents are forced to deal with an empty nest. DONNA (Laura Prepon) grows more popular at the radio station and realizes that a long-distance relationship with Eric isn't going to work, so she starts dating again, eventually meeting the person who may actually be "the one." HYDE (Danny Masterson) runs a successful record store – with Leo (Tommy Chong) as his slacker employee – and makes a final decision about his complicated relationship with JACKIE (Mila Kunis). Meanwhile, FEZ (Wilmer Valderrama) reveals more about his family and home country as he grows into quite the local Lothario. And at the Formans', KITTY (Debra Jo Rupp) has problems with no kids in the house, while RED (Kurtwood Smith) has problems because it still seems like there are always kids in the house.

The eighth season of THAT '70s SHOW will continue the signature elements that have made the series a hit, including the surreal dream sequences, the 360-degree basement scenes and the classic '70s score. The retro series has featured numerous '70s icons since its premiere, including Gloria Gaynor, Shirley Jones, Danny Bonaduce, Charo, Alice Cooper, Marion Ross, Eve Plumb, Ted Nugent, Howard Hesseman, Valerie Harper and Roger Daltrey. Additionally, stars such as Luke Wilson, Lindsay Lohan, Jack Osbourne, Brooke Shields, Seth Green, Jessica Simpson and Shannon Elizabeth have also made guest appearances.
