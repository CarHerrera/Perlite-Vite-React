How does a deep-cover operative keep his sanity and morality intact when the criminal lifestyle he’s sworn to bring down from within is more compelling than his own? Federal Agent Vincent Terranova (Ken Wahl) is plagued by the question in this innovative take on 80’s cop dramas. Created by veteran hit producer Steven J Cannell, Wiseguy veers from traditional ‘bad guy of the week’ police procedural by breaking the drama into multi-episode story arcs that followed an Organized Crimes Bureau case—and its charismatic criminal suspects—to its logical conclusion. No matter the cost to criminal, victim, or cop.

In the end, Vinnie may have got his man, but the emotional toll of the lies and deceptions he used to get close enough to his prey couldn’t be ignored. But he’s ably backed by his Field Supervisor Frank McPike (Jonathan Banks) and his OCB Lifeguard (Jim Byrnes) on the law-and-order side and his brother Father Pete Terranova (Gerald Anthony) on the spiritual side. Plus many up-and-coming stars (Ray Sharkey, Annette Benning, Billy Vera, Kevin Spacey, Fred Dalton Thompson, Ron Silver, Michael Chiklis) cut their teeth on juicy roles as either flashy but flawed criminals or tragic victims of the same. 

Personal problems and injuries caused Wahl to back out of a fourth season and be replaced by Steven Bauer, thereby giving the show a new slant and hastening its cancellation. Still, Wiseguy is referenced by many critics and fans as one of the most literate, stylish, audacious, and fun cop shows of the late 80’s.

Selected story arcs are currently available on DVD.
