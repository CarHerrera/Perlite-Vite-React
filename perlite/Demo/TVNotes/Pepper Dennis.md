Pepper Dennis is a beautiful and ambitious reporter with her sights set on anchoring Chicago's top-rated evening news broadcast. Her career is her top priority, but she does have close friends -- especially the station's makeup artist Kimmy and cameraman Chick, who has a secret crush on Pepper. 

Complicating Pepper's daily life is the fact that her spoiled, needy and recently separated sister Kathy has moved in with her. Worst of all, the hot guy Pepper woke up with this morning, Charlie Babcock, just showed up in the newsroom, grabbed her dream job and is now practically her boss. She's trying to despise him, but Charlie is smart, handsome, funny, available and interested. Office romances can be so complicated.
