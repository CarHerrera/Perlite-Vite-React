Thank God You're Here is an improv competition in which various comedic performers act in scenes without a script. The performers' comedy skills, improvisational fortitude and acting talents are then judged by Dave Foley. The winner receives a 'Thank God You're Here' trophy and 'Hollywood street cred.' This show is derived from the Australian show of the same name.
