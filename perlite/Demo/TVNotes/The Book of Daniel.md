The show focuses on an Episcopalian minister and father. He finds himself conversing with Jesus - his mentor and friend - who helps navigate family problems, church politics and even his nagging reliance on prescription painkillers. 

The pilot was written on spec by "Titus" co-creator Jack Kenny. NBC took the rare step of buying his finished script even though it was not developed through the network's traditional process. 

Kenny and his writing partner, Brian Hargrove, created and shepherded the Christopher Titus comedy "Titus," which ran from 2000-02 on Fox. Additionally, Kenny has directed episodes of "Titus," the WB Network's "Reba," and Titus' recent comedy special for Showtime, "Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding."
