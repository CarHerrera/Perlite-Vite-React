Winston MacBride is a Deputy U.S. Marshal. His job is to pursue interstate fugitives and chase escaped convicts. He does so by using some unorthodox methods to complete his duties. MacBride would rather talk than fight, and use his brains rather than violence. His job takes him all across the country and away from his family. But remember... "He has never let one get away."
