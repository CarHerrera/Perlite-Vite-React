Emily Sanders (Heather Graham)  is a successful young woman with terrific taste, great friends and a fabulous job in publishing. She didn't get to this place in life by accident. She worked hard and always followed a set of self-imposed guidelines referred to as the "Reasons." Reasons why not to take that new job offer, reasons why not to tell a vacation fling to look you up if he's ever in Los Angeles, reasons why not to trust your crafty, back-stabbing former assistant , Glitter Cho (Smith Cho) . However, when Emily crosses professional lines and gets involved with the roguishly handsome, two-timing author of their new best seller, there's no denying somewhere along the way her internal GPS system has crashed. She's got to get back on track, and once again be heedful of the trustworthy reasons that help her navigate her way through life.  Reilly (Nadia Dajani) is a "nonconformist" who is unemployed and still single. She has known Emily since childhood. Reilly has no problem telling it like it is.  Josh (Khary Payton) works at a healing teashop called "Chi for Two".***James Patrick Stuart will become a regular cast member as a business consultant. *** Based on the bestselling novel of the same title, Heather Graham stars in this comedy about one independent woman's adventures in life, friendship, love and their infinite possibilities…
and a funny comedy.Production Companies are Sony Pictures Entertainment and Pariah.
