Set in 2007, Timecop follows the adventures of Jack Logan, the best agent of the Time Enforcement Commission. Based in Washington, D.C., the TEC was formed to hunt down time criminals who try to change the past. Logan's colleagues include TEC Captain Gene Matuzek, historian Dale Easter, and science/tech advisior Claire Hemmings, who in time becomes a TEC field agent accompanying him on missions into the past.  The show was based on the 1994 feature film of the same name, which starred Jean-Claude Van Damme.
