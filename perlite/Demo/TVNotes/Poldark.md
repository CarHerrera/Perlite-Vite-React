First adapted for the BBC/Masterpiece Theatre in 1975-77, the new adaptation of the novels by Winston Graham sees Captain Ross Poldark (Aidan Turner) returning to Cornwall in 1783 after spending three years in the army fighting in the American War for Independence, only to find his father dead, the woman (Heida Reed) he loved engaged to another, and his estate in dire straits. He rescues a young woman (Eleanor Tomlinson) from a beating and hires her as his maid as he seeks to turn his fortunes around.
