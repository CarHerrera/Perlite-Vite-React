The Emmy-winning Babylon 5 brought many exciting innovations to science fiction television.  Computer-generated effects, five-year story arcs, and elaborate mythology made this series stand apart from what came before and point the next generation of sci-fi/fantasy series in bold new directions.  This show realized creator J. Michael Straczynski's vision of creating a five-season novel for television.  Its stories proved that one person can make a difference, that the choices we make (right or wrong, good or bad) have far-reaching consequences, and that humanity is far greater and nobler than given credit for being.Babylon 5 is a five-mile long space station located in neutral space.  Built by the Earth Alliance in the 2250s, it's goal is to maintain peace among the various alien races by providing a sanctuary where grievances and negotiations can be worked out among duly appointed ambassadors.  A council made up of representatives from the five major space-faring civilizations - the Earth Alliance, Mimbari Federation, Centarui Republic, Narn Regime, and Vorlon Empire - work with the League of Non-Aligned Worlds to keep interstellar relations under control.  Aside from its diplomatic function, Babylon 5 also serves as a military post for Earth and a port of call for travellers, traders, businessmen, criminals, and Rangers.  A floating city home to a quarter of a million humans and aliens is bound to experience problems; Babylon 5 has problems in abundance.  Its senior staff of Earth Alliance officers - along with the most prominent members of the diplomatic community - deal with personal problems, cultural differences, threats to station security, and interstellar crises on a regular basis.  Old prejudices and unresolved issues leftover from the Earth-Mimbari War and the Centauri occupation of Narn lead to unexpected developments.  Pro-Human groups and a corrupt government make the Earth of the future far from paradise.  Telepaths seek refuge from the militant Psi Corps while the Mars colony desires support in its bid for independence.  And then there is the growing presence of Shadows in regions close by and on the Outer Rim of known space.  Fate has decreed that Babylon 5 be crucial to deciding the outcome of all of these conflicts.
