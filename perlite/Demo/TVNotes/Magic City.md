Fidel Castro, racial segregation, the Kennedys, and spies are just some of the people and issues surrounding 1959. For Ike Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), his biggest problem is Ben "The Butcher" Diamond (Danny Huston). Six years ago he made a deal to help finance his luxurious Miami Beach hotel, the Miramar Playa, and now The Butcher is back for payment.
