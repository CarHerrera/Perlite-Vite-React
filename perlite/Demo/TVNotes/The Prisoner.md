AMC reinterprets the British 1960s cult classic of the same name in a miniseries format. The miniseries stars Jim Caviezel as "Six" and the legendary Ian McKellen as "Number Two." Six believes that he was a security analyst who resigned from his position, and finds himself trapped in a community known only as "the Village", located in a desert seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Six vows to escape, but must determine  if his memories are his real life, or simply the delusions of a deluded man.
