A talented, eclectic ensemble cast reunites the Joseph family in the hour-long family drama, Soul Food, an Edmonds Entertainment/State Street Pictures production in association with Paramount Network Television for Showtime. Soul Food was the first original Showtime series to receive a second season order from the network. Based on the critically acclaimed film from writer/director George Tillman, Jr. the series Soul Food takes an honest, touching look at tradition and family life through the trials and tribulations of a tight-knit African-American family living in Chicago.  Without missing a beat, Soul Food picks up where the 1997 film left off – with a family trying to do the best it can with what life has dealt them, while facing day to day turmoil that seems to permeate their lives.Although the Joseph's beloved matriarch, Mama Joe (Irma P. Hall, Soul Food), has passed away, she is still there in spirit and her words of wisdom resound through her grandson Ahmad (Aaron Meeks), who is having a hard time adapting to his new role as "man of the house" since his parent's separation. Maxine (Vanessa Williams, Melrose Place) and Kenny (Rockmond Dunbar) found that time apart was the only palpable solution to their problems – at least for the time being. And while Lem (Darrin Dewitt Henson) and Bird (Malinda Williams, High School High) do their best to help reunite the couple, it soon becomes clear to the entire family that Maxine and Kenny just need some time on their own. Teri (Nicole Ari Parker, Loving Jezebel) is wooed by her old company, Greene & Norris, and offered a partnership and chance to head the firm's labor department. However, this opportunity worries Damon (Boris Kodjoe, Love & Basketball) and Maxine who feel that Teri's panic attacks aren't yet a thing of the past. And although the family faces difficult hurdles, they always find their way back to the traditional Sunday dinner that allows them to share each other's company and recognize that they truly mean the world to each other.
