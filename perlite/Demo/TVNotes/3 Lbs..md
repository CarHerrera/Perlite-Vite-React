From executive producer Peter Ocko comes a new medical drama about two elite neurosurgeons who have different takes on how to treat their patients. One cares about them and one who only cares about their brains.

Dr. Douglas Hanson (Stanley Tucci) is a brilliant neurosurgeon and one of the best in New York City. His method is simple. The brain is like a wire box and the patient is not important because that is just the outside. His new partner Dr. Jonathan Seger (Mark Feuerstein) has a totally different point-of-view that psychological health of his patient is the top priority. When these two top doctors are forced to work together on complex operations they are able forget their differences and perform life saving miracles.
