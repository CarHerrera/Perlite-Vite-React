Brewster's Place is a modern day intake of the generation of people living Brewster's Place. This series was inspired the original concept " The Women of Brewster's Place" a feature 
film with stars such as Jackee Harry, Lynn Whitfield, and Oprah Winfrey. The film was such a perceived success that the creators of the series decided that a series would be as phenomenal success as the movie. The series was hilarious, and dramatic in some sense. But with low ratings and a somewhat not strong enough cast, the show ended within a year. Sorry, Brewster Place, for the inconvenience of a good show, but not an interested enough public, cast, and, overall, everyone else. This show depicted how the age of the children might of been. In other words this show focused on the years that the movie, 
"The Women of Brewster Place" may have missed. Such as the years when the children who later grew up were children. This show was originally supposed to last many years to show the full childhood. But due to low ratings, and a somewhat lacking script, it was canceled after one year. To be more specific this show focused on the years that Kiswanna, and the child of Oprah Winfrey's character were indeed children. This show was one of the first for young actor Jason Weaver. But thankfully he went to "Thea" and "Smart Guy" in later years. Also this show was a first for the actress who chronicled the 
character of Kiswanna.
