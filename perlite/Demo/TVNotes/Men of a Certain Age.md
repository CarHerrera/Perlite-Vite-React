There are highs and lows to every age, but three best friends know what it's like to be Men of a Certain Age. Ray Romano stars in an honest, emotional and funny drama about what it is like to be a middle aged man in the modern era.

Romano plays Joe, a divorcee, father of two, and party store owner who has unfulfilled dreams of becoming a professional golfer. His best friends are Owen (Andre Braugher), an overworked family man who is employed at his dad's car dealership, and Terry (Scott Bakula), an outlandish and dashing struggling actor.

Created for television by Romano and Mike Royce, this TNT original production is executive-produced by Romano, Royce, Cary Hoffman, and Everybody Loves Raymond's Rory Rosegarten.
