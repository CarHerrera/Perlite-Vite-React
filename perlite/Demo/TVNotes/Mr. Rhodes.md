MR. RHODES was a short-lived sitcom starring Tom Rhodes who plays an acclaimed but unsuccessful writer (with the same name) who decides to return to his old private school to teach English. There, Tom will meet Nikki (Farrah Forke), a girl from his past, who is now working as a guidance counselor. As days go by, Tom will become a much beloved professor, and sometimes a major punch-line. Sadly, the show was cancelled after only one season, and 2 episodes remain unaired.
