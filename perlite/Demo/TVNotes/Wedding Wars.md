Wedding Wars takes a lighthearted look at the issue of gay marriage starring John Stamos and Eric Dane.  Shel (John Stamos), a gay wedding planner, is asked to plan the wedding of his brother Ben (Eric Dane) and fiancée Maggie (Bonnie Somerville), who is the daughter of the Governor of Maine (James Brolin).  When Shel finds out that his brother Ben is the campaign manager for the governor and is behind the governor’s speech against gay marriage, he goes on strike.  Little does Shel know that his little fight for equal rights will pick up steam and sweep the nation and leave Ben and Maggie with a tacky wedding planner.
