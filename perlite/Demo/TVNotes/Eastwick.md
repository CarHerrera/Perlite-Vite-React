In the rustic suburban village of Eastwick, there live three seemingly ordinary women who possess unique personalities and lead very distinctive lives. Roxanne "Roxie" Torcolleti, an uninhibited artist and a financially-challenged single mom, Kat Gardener, a frustrated wife and an overworked mother of five, and Joanna Frankel, a shy and subdued newspaper reporter, are suddenly brought together thru a strange encounter at the town park. Different they may be from each other, they quickly learn that all of them have one common yearning -- to excite and experience change in their lives.

Incidentally, a charismatic yet enigmatic man named Darryl Van Horne (Paul Gross) arrives in town determined to make their wishes come true. With Van Horne's help, Roxie (Rebecca Romijn), Kat (Jaime Ray Newman), and Joanne (Lindsay Price) soon discover their extraordinary talents and harness them to fulfill their innermost desires. As these enchanting women unleash their magical powers, Eastwick, once peaceful and idyllic, is never quite the same.

Based on the novel of John Updike and the popular 1987 film adaptation, Eastwick also stars Ashley Benson as Roxie's daughter Mia, Jon Bernthal as Kat's husband Raymond, Johann Urb as Joanna's boss Will, Sara Rue as Roxie's best friend Penny, and Veronica Cartwright as Bun Waverly, the head of the Eastwick Historical Society. Created by Maggie Friedman for the small screen, the ABC dramedy is produced by Warner Bros. Television. Acting as executive producer along with Friedman is David S. Rosenthal.
