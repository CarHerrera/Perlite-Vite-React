Dr. Katz is a divorced psychologist who lives with his son, Ben. While trying to help his patients (famous and not famous) with their traumas, paranoias, conflicts and problems, Dr. Katz also handles his own problems. His son Ben is all grown up but still don't know what to do with his life. His hobby is to waste Laura's (Dr. Katz's sarcastic receptionist) time with cheesy pick up lines and useless ideas and inventions. Dr. Katz also frequents a bar, Jacky's 33, and hangs out with his friend Stan and tries to get up the courage to flirt with the owner, Julie. Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist was a cartoon based on Jonathan Katz's personal life. Originally running on Comedy Central, the show aired for 6 seasons, and helped put Comedy Central on the map, along with fellow cartoon hit South Park. Halfway through its sixth season, the network took it off the air and aired most of the remaining episodes on a Christmas marathon later that year, with 3 episodes unaired. Among the patients that sporadically go to Dr. Katz for psychological help we can find familiar faces such as Winona Ryder, David Duchovny, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Ben Stiller, Carrie Fisher, Conan O'Brien, Garry Shandling, Janeane Garofalo, Kathy Griffin, Lisa Kudrow, and Whoopi Goldberg, among others.
