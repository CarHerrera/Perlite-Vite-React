Fox's reality show Unan1mous takes nine contestants and locks them in bunker with no sun light, no outside contact, and not being able to know what time it is. Under these conditions they have to all decide unanimously who will get $1.5 million, but as they fail to make a unanimous decision the money goes down $1 every second and many twists and turns are thrown at them.

The show didn't run for very long. Fox canceled it due to bad reviews.
