The four-part documentary series produced by Mark and Jay Duplass looks at the life of Elizabeth Carmichael, her promise of a fuel-efficient, three-wheeled car in the 1970s and the fraud case that exposed her past that included her life as Jerry Dean Michael and being involved in a counterfeiting operation.
