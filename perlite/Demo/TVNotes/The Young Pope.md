New York cardinal Lenny Belardo (Jude Law) is elected as the new pope through machinations by Cardinal Voiello (Silvio Orlando) who thought the 47-year-old would amenable to his ideas. However, the new Pontiff who takes the name Pius XIII, prefers seeking advice from Sister Mary (Diane Keaton), who raised him at the orphanage.

The 10-part miniseries from Paolo Sorrentino premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2016.
