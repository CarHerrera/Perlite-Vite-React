In the sequel, school's out for summer and now, the competition moves from the fields of high school to the lawns of high society -- also known as the Country Club. When the other East High students get summer jobs there, before long, they face off over the country club's annual mid-summer's night musical production, which Sharpay is dying to get the award for and the winning spot to be Troy's true love.
