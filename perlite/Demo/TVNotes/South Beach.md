South Beach is centered on two best friends, Vince and Matt, who left their lives in Brooklyn behind and moved to the beautiful South Beach in hopes of finding a better future. Matt meets up with his fashion model ex-girlfriend Ariel, who has a new boyfriend Alex, the manager of the nightclub Nocturnal. Alex's mother Elizabeth owns Nocturnal, along with an adjoining hotel named Hotel Soleil, and quickly hires Matt to work for her. Matt has trouble getting along with Alex, and both Matt and Ariel can't seem to settle on just being friends as feelings from their past relationship keep getting in the way. Matt eventually hooks up with Maggie, a waitress at the hotel and bartender at the nightclub, but things still seem to be tense when Matt and Ariel are together. 

Meanwhile, Vincent gains the trust of Fuentes, a powerful player in South Beach's shady underworld, and is offered a job with him. Vincent carries out some pretty odd tasks for Fuentes and gets put in some very intense situations while working for him. He also finds Brianna, a model friend of Ariel, who he believes might be "the one" and sets his sights on her, eventually hooking up with her and beginning a meaningful relationship.
