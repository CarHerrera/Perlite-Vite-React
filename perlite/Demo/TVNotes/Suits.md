Suits is a new legal drama from the USA Network staring Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht. It follows collage drop-out Mike Ross who accidentally lands a job with one of New Yorks best legal closers, Harvey Specter. They soon become a winning team with Mike's raw talent and photographic memory, and he soon reminds Harvey of why he went into the field of law in the first place.
