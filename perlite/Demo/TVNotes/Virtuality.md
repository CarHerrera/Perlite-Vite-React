Twelve astronauts onboard Earth's first starship, the Phaeton, are sent on a ten-year expedition to search for a distant solar system in order to save mankind from a dying Earth.  Coupled with this is the added pressure of the entire voyage being filmed as a reality television show.  To stave off boredom - and potentially madness - the astronauts also spend time in the self-created worlds they experience in virtual reality modules.  Unfortunately, complications soon ensue when a dangerous virus begins killing them - and worse - while they are in their fantasy.  Has a saboteur downloaded this bug, or is it something far more sinister - and profound?
