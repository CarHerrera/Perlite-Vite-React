Dottie Thorson, wife of murdered bounty-hunting legend Ralph "Papa" Thorson, carries on the family business out of financial necessity. She is assisted by her feisty, cynical daughter Brandi, who is much more born to the business than her domesticated mother. They are often assisted by "Tiny" Bellows, who also provides a love interest for Dottie. Rounding out the cast of regulars is their frequent employer, bail bondsman Ricky Guzman.

After a successful TV-Movie, episodes of the series that eventually followed were widely scattered over a long first (and only) season (or maybe three "mini-seasons") and shown in several different time slots, until coming to an end in September 2001.
