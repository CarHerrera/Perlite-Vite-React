"Kitchen Confidential," based on Anthony Bourdain's memoir about food, drugs and working in the kitchens of top restaurants. It is a single camera comedy.Jack Bourdain, played by Bradley Cooper, had it all but that all changed after one wild night. Four years later, he only has a great girlfriend and an average job working in her restaurant as an aide in Pizza Chain Kitchen. But, when Pino Lugeria contacts him to become Head Chef of his famous restaurant, Nolita, Jack knows this is an offer he cannot refuse. To further back up the offer, his girlfriend tells him he cannot afford to pass up an opportunity like this.He then recruits his old friends, Seth Richman (Nicholas Brandon) the pastry chef, Teddy Wong (John Cho), the seafood Chef and Steven (Owain Yeoman) who is his sous-chef. Not everything is perfect, given that the previous wait staff, particularly Mimi (Bonnie Somerville), believe he will run the restaurant into the ground. But Pino, and everyone, will be witnessing if he is capable of steering clear of his old ways.
