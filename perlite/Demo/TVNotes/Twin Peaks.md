"She's dead. Wrapped in plastic."
Date: Friday, February 24, 1989:
Homecoming Queen Laura Palmer is found dead, washed up on a riverbank, wrapped in plastic sheeting. FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper is called in to investigate the murder of this young woman in the small, Northwestern town of Twin Peaks.  What he doesn't know is that in Twin Peaks, no one is innocent.Twin Peaks was created by TV veteran Mark Frost (Hill Street Blues) and edgy filmmaker David Lynch, Academy Award nominated director of The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr.  It aired on ABC from 1990 - 1991. The series, with a few exceptions, followed the interesting convention that one episode equaled one day in the town of Twin Peaks.  This means that after 30 episodes, the series covers just slightly more than one month.After Twin Peaks was canceled by ABC, David Lynch went on to make the prequel film, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, the story of the last seven days of  Laura Palmer.
