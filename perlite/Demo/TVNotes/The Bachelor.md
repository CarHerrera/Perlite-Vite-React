The Bachelor is an original one hour prime-time reality television series that gives one man and 25 women the unique opportunity to find true love in a most exciting and adventurous way.

The Bachelor will get to know the 25 women in a series of fun, exciting and exotic dates that will elicit real and raw emotions.  Along the way he must follow a gradual process of elimination, as his initial 25 bachelorettes are narrowed down week by week by presenting them with a single, red rose. In the end, he will ultimately decide on the one woman who captures his heart. However, at any point along the way, should a woman decide that she is no longer interested in The Bachelor, she may reject his invitation to continue dating. If the women decide to stay, some lucky women will meet his family, and he will visit their hometowns for a slice of their life in an effort to determine the woman with whom he is most compatible.

The Bachelor provides an in-depth, behind-the-scenes glimpse into the lives of each participant involved in this unique dating process. At the end of the journey, this gentleman will have had an unforgettable experience, made new friendships and quite possibly found true love. But the big question is: After all of this, if he pops the question, will she accept?
