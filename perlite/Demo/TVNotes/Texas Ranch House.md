The latest installment in PBS’s popular “House” group of history series is Texas Ranch House.  Texas Ranch House  sends a family back in time to post-Civil War Texas where they experience the hardships and joys of running a cattle ranch.  The family’s objective over the three month course of the project is to round up the 200 head of cattle and sell them at auction for a profit to keep the ranch afloat.  In addition to the Cooke family – Bill and Lisa, and their three daughters Vienna, Lacey, and Hannah – there are a maid, six cowboys, and their foreman.
