Andre Braugher (previously of Homicide: Life on the Street) stars as Ben Gideon. An unorthodox doctor of great skill, a unique bedside manner. He heads the experimental oncology ward at a fictional teaching hospital in New England.  Inspired by the book "The Measure of Our Days" by Dr. Jerome Groupman, Gideon fights to save the lives of critically ill patients with no where else to turn and tries to inspire the next generation of doctors.  

Unfortuantely, due to low Nielson's ratings, Gideon's Crossing was cancelled in May 2001.  However, this critically acclaimed, and undeniably provocative and sophisticated show, still has a large fan base.
