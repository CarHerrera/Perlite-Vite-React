Premiering on the Mosaic app as a branching narrative drama, the more linear six-part miniseries from Steven Soderbergh and Ed Solomon centers on the disappearance of children's book author/illustrator Olivia Lake (Sharon Stone) and the two men she knew: Joel (Garrett Hedlund), and Eric (Frederick Weller).
