Tucker is a family comedy as seen through the eyes of a hopeful 14-year-old boy dealing with divorce, growing up and falling in love for the first time. There's only one thing worse than your dad running off with a 26-year-old; moving in with your self-righteous aunt (Katey Sagal) who, despite her good intentions, thinks you're a troublemaker. Meet Tucker (Eli Marienthal) an all-American kid who's keeping his chin up and his hormones down in a world that tries - but can't - push him around. As he and his mom try to make it on their own, Tucker remains upbeat despite his aunt and her annoying son Leon. In fact, he's already found a positive angle - McKenna, the girl next door. Hanging out with her makes everything great - that and his belief that good times are ahead. [NBC]
