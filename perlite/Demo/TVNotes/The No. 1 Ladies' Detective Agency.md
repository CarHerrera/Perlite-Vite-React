Alexander McCall Smith's popular detective series comes to the small screen courtesy of HBO and the BBC. Oscar winner Anthony Minghella shepherds this project with a two-hour pilot shot in Botswana.

Leading the cast is R&B singer/songwriter Jill Scott playing the role of Precious Ramotswe, a good-natured, intuitive mid-30's woman who took to heart the inspiring lessons of her deceased father. The series tells of her adventures as she puts up the first and only female detective agency in her native country of Botswana.

The detective dramedy has been nominated in the 2009 Television Critics Association Awards for Outstanding New Program of the Year. While the fate of the show still hangs in the balance, HBO has announced that the 1st season DVD is set to be released on September 8, 2009.
