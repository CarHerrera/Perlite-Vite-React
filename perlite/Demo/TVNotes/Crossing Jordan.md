The Boston Medical Examiners office brings us Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh, who is fearless, smart and sexy.  Dr. Garret Macy is Chief Medical Examiner and it is his job to keep Dr. Cavanaugh in check.  With her methods a little on the unorthodox side her relationship with Detective Woody Hoyt is constantly being tested.  It is not just Medical Examiners and Detectives we also have grief counselor Lily Lebowski, criminologist Nigel Townsend, and forensic entomologist "Bug".  This dynamic team takes us though the crime solving process and keeps us guessing. Broadcast History:
