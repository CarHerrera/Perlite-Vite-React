Join Penn Jillette of the legendary magician/comedian pair Penn & Teller as he hosts this exciting new competition.  Contestants must match up the 12 correct identities to 12 total strangers, but they must be careful not to judge a book by its cover because looks can be deceiving!  Each correctly identified identity results in an increased cash prize for the contestant, with a grand prize of $500,000 for matching up all 12 identities.
