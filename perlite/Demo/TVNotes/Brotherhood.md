Brotherhood, a Showtime original series, follows the lives of two brothers in the Providence, Rhode Island Irish-American neighborhood known as “The Hill”.  The blue-collar neighborhood has roots in old-world ways of street justice and shady dealings.  Tommy Caffee (Jason Clarke) is a family man and local politician who is out to protect the community and its best interests.  His world is turned around when his gangster brother Mike (Jason Isaacs) returns to “The Hill” to regain control of the seedy underworld. Brotherhood's name was changed twice while it was being worked on, the other two names were: Down City and The Hill.
