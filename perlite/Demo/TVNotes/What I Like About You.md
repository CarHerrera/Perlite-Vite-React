When their dad took a job in Japan, teenage livewire Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) and her straight-laced (twentysomething-year-old) sister, Valerie (Jennie Garth), move in together in New York City . Just when Val thought she had the perfect existence - a promising career in public relations, her own Upper West Side apartment (now Loft), and plenty of eligible men to date - everything in her neatly regimented life started to unravel the minute Holly stumbled through the door. Their new life together will take a lot of getting used to, but Val and Holly's relationship is stronger than ever. In early 2006, when The WB and UPN decided to combine to form a new network known as The CW, the number of WB and UPN shows being ported over to The CW were cut back in order to make room for new programming. This show was one of the many WB shows that suffered as a result of the networks joining, and was canceled in early 2006, and the series finale aired in March, leaving the final season at only 18 episodes.
