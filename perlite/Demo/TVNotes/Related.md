The WB series Related, comes from the creative forces behind Friends and Sex and the City. The series tells the story of the lives of the four Sorelli sisters and their complicated lives as a family unit as well as their career and relationship tribulations as young adult women in New York City.

Taking a closer look at the sister's lives, Ginnie is a high powered attorney who is happily married and adjusting at being a soon-to-be mom after finding out she's pregnant. Second eldest sister, Anne is moving on with her life after her long time relationship with boyfriend Danny has just ended.

Next on the sister scale is Marjee who is a bit flighty as a party coordinator and newly evicted tenant that has to move back into her father's home and deal with his new fiance Renee. The youngest sister , Rose is adjusting to changing majors at college from Pre Med to Theatre and trying to not disappoint her family.

With all of this happening the sisters must also cope with each other. The Sorelli sisters may have difficult times with one another as they are all different, but in the end they stay as close as anyone in a family can get.
