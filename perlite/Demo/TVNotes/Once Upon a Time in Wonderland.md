Our story begins as many tales of imagination begin . . . . "Once Upon a Time" . . . . only this time it is, "Once Upon a Time in Wonderland". Yes, Wonderland a land filled with marvelous and fantastic places and characters, teeming with adventure and mystery, a land where a beautiful young girl once went . . . . but no one would believe her tale.  In fact they tried to say she was a bit insane, troubled, lost in her imagination.
The time was Victorian England and the young and beautiful Alice (played by Sophie Lowe) was about to have her memories forcibly removed by her doctors.  That strange land that existed of all places . . . . on the other side of the rabbit hole.  A strange place, a place with an invisible cat, a White Rabbit (played by John Lithgow), talking playing cards, a hookah smoking caterpillar, and of course we cannot forget to mention the Red Queen (played by the very lovely Emma Rigby).
Alice knows however that her doctors are about to make her forget all about Wonderland.  Alice is especially ready to forget the painful memories of Cyrus the genie (played by Peter Gadiot) who she gave her heart to and yet lost forever when she returned to the "real" world.  Perhaps Alice is insane as her doctors would have her believe, perhaps Alice did imagine it all, yet down deep in her heart she knows it was real; but who will save poor Alice from losing all the memories she holds deep in her mind and in her heart?
The White Rabbit along with the Knave of Hearts (played by Michael Socha) arrive just in time to prevent Alice from losing her memories.  Now it is time for Alice and her friends to return to Wonderland, so down the three of them tumble, yes down the rabbit hole they go and Alice can continue her marvelous tale of "Once Upon a Time in Wonderland".
