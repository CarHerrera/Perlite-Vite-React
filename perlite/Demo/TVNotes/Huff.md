Dr. Craig "Huff" Huffstodt (Hank Azaria) is a very successful psychiatrist who is thrown into turmoil after a 15 year old patient commits suicide in his office.  

Huff's family consists of his son Byrd (Anton Yelchin), brother Teddy (Andy Comeau), his antagonistic mother Izzy (Blythe Danner), who is critical and nosey, but means well, and his strong-willed wife Beth (Paget Brewster).  Huff's best friend, Russell Tupper (Oliver Pratt), makes frequent appearances to provide a different perspective.

This is the story of a psychiatrist who has spent his entire life helping others find peace and clarity while his own state of mind is in constant question.  The suicide of his patient has now forced him to re-evaluate everything.  We watch as a midlife crisis erupts into brief outbursts of delusion.  The series is interspersed with fantasy sequences which expose Huff's take on his family and work as he struggles with his daily life.
