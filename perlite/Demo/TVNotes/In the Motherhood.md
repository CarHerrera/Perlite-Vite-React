Megan Mullally ("Will & Grace") and Cheryl Hines ("Curb Your Enthusiasm") star as single mothers coping with juggling their kids, their careers, and the men in their lives in this ABC half-hour sitcom. The show is based on the 2007 web series of the same name, where real mothers submitted their stories of raising children, which served as inspirations for storylines in the show.

This series was cut from 13 episodes to just 6 for it's first season.
