Amy Sherman-Palladino, creator of Gilmore Girls, brings us this multi-camera comedy about how two estranged sisters who are polar opposites try to raise a baby together. Boston Legal's Parker Posey was cast in the lead role in this comedy pilot as Sarah Tomkins. Sarah is an intelligent, optimistic and determined woman who has it all. She's a successful editor of children's books with a very helpful assistant Buddy (The Good Shepherd's Michael Arden) who keeps her life together. Also she has a steady, no-strings-attached relationship with businessman Marcus Sonti (Gilmore Girls's Scott Cohen) a confirmed bachelor. Also Oz Dana Ivey will star as Molly an unspecified character on the series. At the same time Sarah's father, Ronald(Trump Unauthorized Ron McLarty) always reminds her that although she has the perfect job and boyfriend, something is missing in her life. When Sarah comes home from work she feels alone and she is also not getting any younger, so she decides to get pregnant. But the doctor soon tells her that she cannot have children, so Sarah begins an alternate plan.  When she can't find anyone she can count on to have the baby for her, she turns to her estranged sister Coco (Six Feet Under's Lauren Ambrose). Coco refuses at first, but when Sarah mentions that she has turned Jezebel James, Coco's imaginary childhood friend, into a story book, Coco begins to take her sister's idea more seriously. Coco thinks about her current living status on her friend's couch and decides to go ahead with her sister's plan. Sherman-Palladino has also served as director and executive producer on the show, which was produced by Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions and Regency Television. FOX had ordered 13 episodes for the first season, but only seven were made, and they stopped airing it after only three episodes.
