It's tough being a professional athlete. Sure, there are big bucks. And big time glory. But there's also responsibility. Temptations. The media. Hangers on. More temptation. Diminishing skills. Lost endorsements. An uncertain future. Still more temptations. In the fast lane of pro sports, an athlete needs someone he can trust. He needs a friend. An adviser. A big brother. Today's sports superstar needs more than just an agent, he needs a super agent. He needs Arliss.

Characters:

Arliss Michaels: Arliss Michaels claims to be the "working man's friend." He is the super athlete's super-agent, wheeling and dealing in the higher echelons of the sports world--an arena filled with glamour, hypocrisy and money. Arliss Michaels, sports agent extraordinaire, is not above misbehaving as outrageously as his superstar clients in an effort to get what he wants when he wants it.

Rita Wu Rita is Arliss' no-nonsense Girl Friday, seven days a week. As Arliss once said, "If there were a Franklin Day Planner event in the Olympics, Rita would take the gold." Rita's the one you want in your boat, ready to pass out life preservers and give directions. With enormous appeal and sass, she is often the moral voice in the AMM chorus, although she does have a certain weakness for Latin golf clients. Kirby Carlisle Kirby is an ex-football star turned agent as well as Arliss' old college buddy and first client. Endearingly ineffective, partially productive and effectively destructive, Kirby has a fondness for gambling, women and other distractions. The junior partner at Arliss Michaels Management (AMM), Kirby best orchestrates a night on the town for restless, action-seeking clients. Stanley Babson On the surface, Stanley appears to be Arliss' buttoned-up, straight-laced, conservative chief financial officer. Beneath his perfect three-piece suit lurks a buttoned-up, straight-laced, conservative chief financial officer. Stanley works magic with AMM clients' financial portfolios, with only an occasional investment blunder in a bum racehorse or pyramid scheme.
