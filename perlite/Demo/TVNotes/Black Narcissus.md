Set in 1934, Sister Clodagh (Gemma Arterton) brings a group of nuns to the palace of Mopu in the Himalayas to establish a new convent, but secrets and arrivals of Mr. Dean (Alessandro Nivola) and General Dilip Rai (Chaneil Kular) bring forth forbidden desires in this three-episode limited series based on the novel by Rumer Godden (that was also adapted into a 1947 film of the same name).
