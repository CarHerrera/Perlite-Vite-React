The Flash is the story of Barry Allen, a police scientist who is the victim of a freak accident. While working late, his lab is hit by lightning. The blast shatters a number of vials, so Barry is both electrocuted and bathed in dozens of chemicals. When he recovers, Barry finds that he has gained the ability to move at almost impossible speed. Fellow scientist Christina "Tina" McGee works with Barry to help him control his new found powers, even constructing a frictionless suit for him which will not be destroyed by his speed. Donning the red and yellow suit, Barry hides his identity from the world as he uses his powers to fight those who the police cannot catch. In doing so he begins to create the legend of the anonymous scarlet speedster known as The Flash.
