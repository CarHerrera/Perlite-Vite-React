A young girl named Mitchie Torres is desperate to go to Camp Rock. When her mom is hired as the Camp's cook, she gets to go as long as she helps out in the kitchen. When she is overheard singing by rock star Shane Gray, who goes to the camp to get an attitude adjustment, he sets out to find the mystery girl with the wonderful voice. Mitchie has no idea that Shane ever heard her sing so she doesn't try to get him to hear her voice. But when camp queen Tess Tyler, the daughter of mega-star TJ Tyler, finds out Shane is looking for Mitchie, she makes sure that he will never hear her sing.
