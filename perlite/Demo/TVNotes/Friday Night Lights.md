In the small town of Dillon, Texas, football is everything. The team to beat is the Panthers, who are coached by newbie Eric Taylor. Coming back after winning the State Championship, the Panthers will need all the help they can get once the next football season arrives, amidst all the personal dramas and injuries.

This series is based on the book and movie Friday Night Lights. Season two of Friday Night Lights was cut from twenty two to just fifteen completed episodes because of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. In order to save the show and produce a new season, DirecTV stepped up and will air new episodes of season three on DirecTV's "The 101" during the fall, and then they will premiere during the winter on NBC. Both seasons can be found on DVD, as well as repeats on Bravo.
