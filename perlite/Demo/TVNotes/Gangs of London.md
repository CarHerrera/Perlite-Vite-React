The British crime drama created by Gareth Evans begins with the assassination of crime lord Finn Wallace (Colm Meaney), which creates a power vacuum. His son, Sean Wallace (Joe Cole), seeks to take over with the help of Ed Dumani (Lucian Msamati), but the Albanian Mafia, the Kurds, the Pakistanis, and Welsh travellers all see an opening to expand their own power.
