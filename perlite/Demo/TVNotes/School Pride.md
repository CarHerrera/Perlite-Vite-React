When America's public schools are out for a routine inspection hosts Tom Stroup, Kym Whitley, Jacob Soboroff, and Susie Castillo are out to give a makeover. School Pride features a cast of spirit team members who work together to turn around some of America's trashiest public schools. Since it's no secret that high scores stem from a healthy school environment, the Spirit team is out to test for the truth. The team works together to  clean up schools and share the comments of happy children, teachers, and parents based on the transformations.
