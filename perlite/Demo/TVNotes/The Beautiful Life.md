Swingtown's creator and showrunner Mike Kelley and Carol Barbee develop a primetime soap that will follow the privileged lives of male and female models residing in New York City.

The Last House On The Left's Sara Paxton and The Cutting Edge 3's Ben Hollingsworth play the lead roles in the soap as Raina Marinelli, an up-and-coming model billed as "the next Heidi Klum" and Chris Andrews, an innocent town's boy.

High School Musical's Corbin Bleu, The OC's Mischa Barton, Secret Diary of a Call Girl's Ashley Madekwe, Nico Tortorella and real life model Elle MacPherson round out the main cast of The Beautiful Life: TBL.

The Beautiful Life: TBL was inspired by the real life experiences of model-turned-writer Adam Giaudrone. The series will be produced by Ashton Kutcher.
