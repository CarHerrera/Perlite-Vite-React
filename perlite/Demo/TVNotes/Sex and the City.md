Carrie Bradshaw writes a column about sex and relationships in New York city. With three of her closest friends: Samantha Jones, who owns her own PR firm and is more interested in exciting "one-nighters" than long-term relationships; Miranda Hobbes, a cynical lawyer who prioritizes her career over her erratic lovelife, and Charlotte York, an art gallery curator who is a bit prudish when it comes to sex, but hasn't yet lost her faith in finding true love.

Based on the bestselling book by Candace Bushnell, "Sex and the City" revolves around the lives of four young professional women in search of the perfect relationship...and orgasm!
