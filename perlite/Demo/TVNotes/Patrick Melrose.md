The five-episode limited series based on the novels by Edward St. Aubyn spans several decades of Patrick Melrose's (Benedict Cumberbatch) life that included physical abuse from his father (Hugo Weaving), a mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who did nothing to stop it, alcoholism, heroin addiction, recovery, marriage, and fatherhood.
