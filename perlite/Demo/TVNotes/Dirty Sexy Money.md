When idealistic attorney Nick George's father dies, he ends up taking his father's clients, the Darlings, led by patriarch Tripp. It's not always easy for Nick handling both legal and sometimes illegal matters.

Nick George goes through each episode trying to solve and correct the problems of each of the Darling family members. From fighting siblings to a dishonest husband to dealing with Tripp himself; Nick George certainly has his hands full in Dirty Sexy Money.

The hour-long pilot was penned by Craig Wright and will be executive produced by Wright, Bryan Singer, and Greg Berlanti. The pilot is produced by ABC Television Studio in association with Berlanti Television.
