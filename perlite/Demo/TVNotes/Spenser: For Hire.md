Robert Urich plays the single-named detective in this Boston-set adaptation of Robert B. Parker's Spenser novels. The series, which also starred Avery Brooks (whose character later got a short-lived spinoff series, A Man Called Hawk), ran for three seasons on ABC, though it was later followed by four made-for-TV movies that aired on Lifetime in the early 1990s.
