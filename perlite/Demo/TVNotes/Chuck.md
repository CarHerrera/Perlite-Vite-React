The O.C. creator Josh Schwartz and director McG (We Are Marshall) bring us Chuck, a series laced with humor about young twenty-something spies.

Zachary Levi (Less Than Perfect) plays Chuck Bartowski, a nerdy computer tech who has a database of government secrets downloaded into his brain. Chuck soon finds himself recruited by John Casey (Adam Baldwin), a veteran NSA Agent, for espionage work with his new partner (and first date in 10 years) Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski) - leading Chuck to live a split life of computer geek and secret NSA missions.
