Based loosely on the Elmore Leonard (which also spawned the 1995 movie of the same name), Nevada hitman Miles Daly (Chris O’Dowd) is in Hollywood seeking to make a career change after the estrangement from his wife and daughter. He runs into B-movie producer Rick Moreweather (Ray Romano) and convinces him to help him make a film.
