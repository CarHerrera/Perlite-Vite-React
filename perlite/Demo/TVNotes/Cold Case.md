Cold Case stars Kathryn Morris (Minority Report, Mindhunters) as Lilly Rush, the lone female detective in the Philadelphia homicide squad who finds her calling when she's assigned to "cold cases" -- crimes that have never been solved. Previously, she used her instinctive understanding of the criminal mind on current murders. Now, she's interrogating witnesses whose lives and circumstances have since changed, making use of today's new science and finding fresh clues to solve cases that were previously unsolvable, all of which appeals to this smart, driven detective. She's also prepared for the consequences: that her work will open up old wounds and may lead suspects to commit new crimes. When she hits a dead-end, Lilly seeks advice from her respected mentor, Lt. John Stillman (John Finn, Catch Me If You Can). Also on the team are Det. Scotty Valens (Danny Pino, The Shield), Rush's confident and strong-willed partner; Det. Will Jeffries (Thom Barry, The Fast and the Furious), who's been around long enough to serve as Lilly's link to the past; and Det. Nick Vera (Jeremy Ratchford, Angel Eyes), a tough cop who's considered the go-to guy for getting a confession. Lilly makes it her business to ensure that no victim is ever forgotten. On the show's third season, former narcotics detective Kat Miller (Tracie Thoms, Wonderfalls, As If), a young and spunky girl, joins the team.

Cold Case is created by Meredith Stiehm (ER, NYPD Blue). Executive producers -- in addition to Ms. Stiehm -- include such reigning entertainment industry names as Jerry Bruckheimer (The Amazing Race, CSI), Shaun Cassidy (Invasion, The Agency), and Jonathan Littman (The Amazing Race, Close to Home).
