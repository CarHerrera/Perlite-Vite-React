Therapist Ann Bellowes is in need of some therapy of her own. Part of her problem, though, is finding her husband having an affair with their couple's counselor. Ann and her colleagues run the  New Haven Psychiatrist Associates in a converted Victorian house.With her husband gone she must find someone else to fill the office space and rents it out to young lawyer Barry White. Barry soon adjusts to being the only lawyer surrounded by therapists who enjoy teasing him about his name.Other therapists in the office include a specialist in child psychology, Dr. James LeCroix, who sometimes resorts to methods of therapy which can be considered radical. The office is not free of romance as psychologist Dr. Cordelia Banks engages in trysts with the married Dr. Taj Kalid. Amidst all the chaos Fred Smedresman can be found trying to keep the flow of the surroundings on an even keel as the office manager.
