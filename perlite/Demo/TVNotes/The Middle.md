This new comedy series uses a mother's point of view to shed light on the lives of a middle-class family in the Midwest.
The show focuses on the Heck family's life in an Indiana suburb and is narrated by Frankie, a dedicated—though frazzled—mother who works at a local car dealership and volunteers for school functions. Father Mike works at a quarry and takes a more laid back approach to most things, but backs up Frankie with force when the need arises. Oldest child Axl, a snarky, surly, high schooler, spends much of his time napping and roams around the home shirtless. Geeky, gangly, braces-wearing Sue is trying to navigate her way through junior high, join the cool crowd, and avoid Axl's endless onslaught of taunts, none of which she does with much success. Youngest child Brick is in elementary school and is the academic in the family, but suffers from near-crippling social anxieties and possesses an odd habit of repeating words he just said back to himself in a loud whisper.
Starring Patricia Heaton and Neil Flynn, the Warner Bros. Television pilot was written by Eileen Heisler and DeAnn Heline, who also serve as executive producers.
