L.A. district attorney Maya Travis (Robin Tunney) left for Washington State after losing a high-profile double murder case against an A-list actor (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje). Eight years later, the same actor is again accused of murder and returns for another chance in this legal drama from Marcia Clark, Liz Craft and Sarah Fain.
