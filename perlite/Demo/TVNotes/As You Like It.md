Kenneth Branagh brings one of Shakespeare’s best plays to HBO.  Set in 19th century Japan, the tale follows Rosalind, the daughter of a banished duke who is forced in to exile after her uncle threatens to have her killed.  For safety’s sake Rosalind disguises herself as a man.  Her disguise comes in handy when she tests the devotion of her admirer Orlando.  The story is full of a sense of love and justice.
