No it's not a revival of Fox's 2008 series of the same name, but a medical drama inspired by Bellevue Hospital where new medical director Dr. Max Goodwin (Ryan Eggold) seeks to return the hospital to its former glory with a staff that includes Dr. Hana Sharpe (Freema Agyeman), ER doctor Dr. Laura Bloom (Janet Montgomery), attending cardiac surgeon Dr. Floyd Pearson (Jocko Sims), attending child psychiatrist Dr. Iggy Frome (Tyler Labin), and the oldest doctor on staff Dr. Anil Kapoor (Anupam Kher).
