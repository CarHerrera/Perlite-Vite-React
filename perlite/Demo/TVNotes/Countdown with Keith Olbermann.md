Countdown with Keith Olbermann follows the mild mannered, funny, and intelligent news anchor Keith Olbermann, as he takes you through the top five news stories of the day.  These stories range from the important events of the day with live Countdown exclusive interviews and the thoughts of Keith Olbermann and his staff. During the countdown, Keith does special segments like "Keeping Tabs", where he informs the viewers on celebrity action only Countdown could dish out. Also Keith pokes fun at the lame, out of this world, and just flat out stupid news events on the segment "Oddball". Viewers could see a condensed one hour recap of the day's events on Countdown with Keith Olbermann as it aired Mondays through Fridays on MSNBC at 8pm eastern and a repeat showing at 11:00pm and 4:00am eastern on MSNBC. In January 2011 Keith Olbermann accepted a contract buy out by MSNBC, in the Spring of 2011 he was hired by Current TV.
