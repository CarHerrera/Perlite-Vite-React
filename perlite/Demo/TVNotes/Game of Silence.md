25 years ago, Jackson (David Lyons) Gil (Michael Raymond-James), Shawn Polk (Larenz Tate) and Boots (Derek Phillips) Jessie (Bre Blair) caused an accident that sent them to the Quitman Youth Detention Facility. The secret the four kept from their time there reemerges in this drama series based on the Turkish series Suskunlar (which was based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's 1995 novel Sleepers)
