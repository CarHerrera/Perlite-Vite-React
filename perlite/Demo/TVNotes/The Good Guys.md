The Good Guys is an action comedy about two detectives stuck in small crimes, though their "routine investigations" (Code 58s) often lead them into bigger cases and even bigger trouble. Jack Bailey (Colin Hanks), a cop who follows the rules but has an annoying habit of making enemies higher up, is paired with Dan Stark (Bradley Whitford), an unpredictable old-school cop whose heroic rescue of  the Governor's son 30 years ago keeps him employed. Even so, Dan's drinking and antics leave him stuck with Jack in the Property Crimes Division. Jack's only ally is his ex, Assistant District Attorney Liz Traynor (Jenny Wade), who must balance chastising the troublesome duo with standing up for their unconventional police prowess to their boss Lieutenant Ana Ruiz (Dianna Maria Riva). Creator and Executive Producer Matt Nix (Burn Notice) originally conceived the series 10 years ago as a feature film script Jack & Dan to reinvent the buddy-cop comedy-action drama.
