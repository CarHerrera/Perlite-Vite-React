The Unusuals is described as a crime procedural dramedy set in modern-day New York City. Sometimes life takes an unexpected turn, as in the morning Casey Shraeger, a vice detective, is assigned to work undercover as a hooker by the Lincoln Tunnel and later finds herself a part of the homicide squad. As Casey gets to know her new co-workers, she discovers that each one has their own quirks, not to mention, their own secrets.

Det. Walsh is a loyal and brilliant officer whose partner was just gunned down. Det. Delahoy has a brain tumor along with a death wish while his partner Det. Banks, who wears a bullet-proof vest to sleep, fears he won't make it past 42 years old. Det. Cole is very religious but seems to have a shady past, and his partner Det. Beaumont is a tough female cop amongst the male-dominated precinct. Det. Alvarez talks about himself in the third person and is often the object of his colleagues' pranks.

Casey herself has her own secrets as she was born into one of the richest families in New York City and doesn't want anyone to know about it. The Unusuals, described by some as "a modern-day M*A*S*H", was created by Noah Hawley and is produced by Denis Leary, Peter Tolan, and Jim Serpico, executive producer of FX's Rescue Me. ABC has picked up The Unusuals for mid-season 2008/2009 with an initial season order of 10 episodes. Due to not-so-great ratings, ABC opted not to renew the series for a second season.
