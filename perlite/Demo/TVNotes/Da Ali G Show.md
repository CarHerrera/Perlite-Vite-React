  Da Ali G Show is a   British comedic television series that ran for one season on Channel 4 of the   BBC. It was later purchased by HBO and new episodes appeared on American   television for three seasons. Da Ali G Show features comedian Sasha Baron   Cohen, who appears as different characters in numerous skits with unwitting   participants. His "Ali G" character is a white rapper who hosts his   own talk show in which he asks guests outlandish questions about politics,   the media and (mostly) their personal lives. Most guests believe Ali G is   perfectly serious about his questions, despite their absurd nature. Another   popular character is "Borat Sagdiyev," an immigrant from Kazakhstan   who often embarrasses those whom he is interviewing by engaging in   anti-Semitic, misogynistic speech and strange Kazakh customs. Another regular   character on Da Ali G Show is "Bruno," a gay Austrian television   personality who typically ridicules his guests by having them offer   exaggerated praise or criticism of celebrities. Both Borat and Bruno would   later appear in successful American features films.
