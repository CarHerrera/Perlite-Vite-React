Airing on consecutive nights, the three-part miniseries based on John le Carré's novel of the same name is set in the 1970s where a chance encounter in Greece between Charlie (Florence Pugh), an actress on vacation and a mysterious man named Becker (Alexander Skarsgård), soon becomes much more as she becomes part of high stakes spy plot masterminded by mastermind Kurtz (Michael Shannon).
