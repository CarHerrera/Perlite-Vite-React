A ruthless police captain runs a squad of quirky detectives while angling to get elected mayor of New York City in this brief sitcom. The show is most remembered (if at all) for yielding guest star Henry Winkler an Emmy nomination, only to have it rescinded when the TV Academy learned that the episode aired after its official deadline period.
