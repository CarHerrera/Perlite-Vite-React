This four-episode British miniseries is a political thriller based on the novel by Michael Dobbs, which follows a scheming MP (played by Ian Richardson) in his quest to become Prime Minister. The adaptation comes from Andrew Davies (Bridget Jones's Diary). House of Cards aired in the U.S. on PBS as part of Masterpiece Theatre in early 1991, and was remade over two decades later as the Netflix original series of the same name (starring Kevin Spacey).
