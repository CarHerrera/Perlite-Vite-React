Hot Properties centers around four women who work for Hot Properties, a high-end Manhattan real estate firm.  Ava Summerlin, the oldest of the women, runs the firm.  She's married to a much-younger man, which makes her feel old and at times causes some problems in their marriage.  Lola Hernandez has recently divorced her husband of ten years after finding out he's gay  Lola is often scared to start dating again because she fears her "gay-dar" skills are severely lacking.  Chloe Reid seems to have a lot of trouble with men, never finding a guy who truly cares for her.  The newest employee of Hot Properties, the young and rich Emerson Ives, was originally a client of Hot Properties.  She seems to run into a lot of trouble with her fiancé and often seeks advice from the other girls at the office.

Rounding out the cast is the divorced therapist Dr. Sellers Boyd, the sexy dermatologist Dr. Charlie Thorpe, and the floor's sarcastic receptionist Mary.  Though everyone at the office may be at different stages in their lives, they all work together well and are there for each other when it really matters.
