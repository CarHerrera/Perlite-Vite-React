Dave's World is based on Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist Dave Barry's syndicated columns. Dave is a child of the '60s trying to survive in the '90s, confronting the absurdities of life - as husband, father and semi-responsible citizen. He muddles through with the help of his wife, Beth, who's weary of being the responsible one; sons Tommy, 12, and Willie, 8; his college buddies, Kenny, whose claim to fame is that he records books-on-tape, and Shel, an overworked plastic surgeon who is still bitter over his not-so-recent divorce. Adding to their hectic lives is Mia, Dave's bubbly assistant who just moved in next door with her husband-to-be, Eric, the Barry's jack-of-all-trades handyman.

The "framing device" for each episode is Dave at work on his newspaper column. The episode then illustrates his inspiration for the column.

The theme song was a version of "You May Be Right" sung by Southside Johnny.
