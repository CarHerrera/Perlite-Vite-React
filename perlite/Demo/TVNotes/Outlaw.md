Frustrated with flaws in the legal system, Supreme Court Justice Cyrus Garza gives up his lifetime appointment. Hoping to change the system from his private practice, Garza and his team use inside knowledge of the legal system to help "the little guy". Each case takes them around the country to some of the most difficult and controversial issues. A playboy and a gambler, Garza has more than his legal battles to deal with. John Eisendrath and Conan O'Brian are executive producers for Outlaw.
