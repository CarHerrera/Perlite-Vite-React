When Sabrina Spellman is informed by her aunts, Hilda and Zelda, on her 16th birthday, that she is a witch, she is hesitant to believe them. Having been sent to live with them in Massachusetts by her warlock father and mortal mother, Sabrina learns the tricks of magic in order to receive her witch's license. Along the way, she gets into many scrapes while figuring out how certain spells work. She also has to keep the secret from her boyfriend, Harvey, friends Jenny and later Valerie, stuck-up nemesis Libby, and her ever-suspicious vice-principal, Mr. Kraft.

Now entering adulthood, Sabrina begins a career in journalism with her first paying job at "Scorch", an alternative music magazine that focuses on everything and anything "cutting edge".

After 7 seasons, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch ended, but remains a popular show among fans.
