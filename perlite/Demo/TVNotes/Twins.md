"Twins" is The WB's latest comedy installment. The series revolves around two twin sisters, Mitchee (Sara Gilbert) and Farrah (Molly Stanton), who are complete opposites.

Their parents, Alan (Mark Linn-Baker) and Lee (Melanie Griffith), have decided it is time to pass down their business to their daughters. Mitchee resembles her dad, as she is smart and determined. Farrah is most like her mom; beautiful but not so bright. However, besides their differences, they will have to join forces to keep the business running.

"Twins" comes from the creators of the hit comedy "Will & Grace". The series premieres Friday, September 16 at 8:30/7:30c only on The WB network.
