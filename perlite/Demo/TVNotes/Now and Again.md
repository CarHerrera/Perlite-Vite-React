Now and Again premiered on CBS television in September 1999 and focused on what would happen if a dead man's brain were removed and placed in a body with superhuman strength and mental powers. Michael Wiseman, now Michael Newman, was drafted to assist a government scientist on a variety of projects. Michael's refusal to give up his family from his "past life," however, proved more difficult to contend with than any in the government could ever have guessed.Build a man with the speed of Michael Jordan, the strength of Superman and the grace of Fred Astaire. A guy who's going to look good, be young, be omnipotent. Wild, huh?
The Six Million Dollar Man for the new millennium maybe?  It could have been. It featured a unique concept and a strong cast, many of which now appear in various popular series. but a massive audience never really caught on for the program. Though the program had a strong cult following and many efforts were made to revive it and have it released on DVD. As of 2006, however, no DVD set is available.All said and done, this was a series that likely should have done better than it did. It was funny, with great action scenes and compelling emotional plots. It also featured a strong cliffhanger ending, one which there will likely never be a resolution to.
