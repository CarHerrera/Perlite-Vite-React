In this bizarre, post-modern version of L. Frank Baum's novel 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' and the classic movie based on the book, 'The Wizard of Oz',  Zooey Deschanel stars as DG, the main character who finds herself trapped in a place called the O.Z. or the Outer Zone. There she searches for her parents and is joined in her travels by Glitch, a man who has had half of his brain taken away because of something he knew, Raw, a member of a species called the "viewers" who read emotions and heal, and Cain - a "Tin Man" (which was the name of the police force in the O.Z. before the witch, Azkadellia took over, taken from their sheriff's tin badges) who seeks revenge for the damage done to his heart.
