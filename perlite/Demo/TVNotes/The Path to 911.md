Where were you on 9/11? Relive the events of that fateful day and the years leading up to it with this ABC miniseries that takes you to the streets of New York, drops you in the center of a riot in Pakistan, and into the meeting rooms of the CIA, the FBI, and the White House. A dramatization of the events detailed in 2004’s national bestseller The 9/11 Commission Report, this small screen experience zeroes in on the experiences of key political and law enforcement players involved. By focusing on the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 and all followed until September 11, 2001, this miniseries seeks to shed light on how to protect America in the future.
