Marie Adler (Kaitlyn Dever) reports she was raped in her home, but the police don't believe her. In another state, Detectives Grace Rasmussen (Toni Collette) and Karen Duvall (Merritt Wever) investigate a possible serial rapist in this limited series based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning article (and an This American Life radio episode) about the real cases.
