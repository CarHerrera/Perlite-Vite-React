American Inventor is a show about the biggest search ever for America's best new invention. The show sets out to uncover the hottest new product each season and make one struggling inventor's dream come true. With one million dollars at stake, American Inventor celebrates the best in homespun American ingenuity.National casting calls were held in six major cities across the country. Thousands of inventors, tinkerers and entrepreneurs of all ages were drawn to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Houston, and Tampa for a shot at turning their dreams into realities. Inventors of all ages presented their most prized inventions, featuring everything from the wacky to the heart warming.A panel of expert judges narrows down the initial entries to a group of finalists, who are given $50,000 each to develop their product, refine it and take it to the next level. This is a show that makes the American dream come true for one person -- taking his/her idea, vision and creativity and helping to turn it into a mass produced product that will be in every American home -- but in the end it is up to America to call in and vote on which invention is worthy of the one million dollar prize.American Inventor is produced by FremantleMedia North America, Simon Cowell's Syco Television and Peter Jones TV Ltd. Simon Cowell, Cecile Frot-Coutaz, Siobhan Greene, Peter Jones and Clay Newbill are executive producers. Dug James and Tabitha Hansen are co-executive producers.
