Adapted from the 1998 Steven Soderbergh film "Out of Sight" and based on characters from crime novelist Elmore Leonard, Karen Sisco (Carla Gugino) is a U.S. marshal working on Miami's Gold Coast. She tracks down fugitives, regularly calling on her laid-back father (Robert Forster), a semi-retired private eye (Robert Forster).
