Nominated for six Emmy Awards and five Golden Globes (including Best Comedy), "Just Shoot Me" is the critically acclaimed ensemble comedy from multiple award-winning writer/producer Steven Levitan. Now entering its seventh season, the series shifts to Tuesday nights after generating top-10 demographic ratings over the past two seasons as part of NBC's top-rated "Must See TV" Thursday lineup. Set in the New York editorial offices of the fictional fashion magazine Blush, "Just Shoot Me" follows the lives of Blush's colorful staff, including Maya Gallo (Laura San Giacomo), a serious journalist who is determined to change the magazine's "fluffy" tone despite the efforts of her father, Blush publisher Jack Gallo (George Segal), who remains focused solely on his bottom line and the things he feels women want. Also on staff are beauty and fashion editor Nina Van Horn (Wendie Malick), a fast-living, neurotic ex-model; Blush's commitment-phobic, in-house photographer, Elliott DiMauro (Enrico Colantoni), and Jack's wisecracking, power-hungry assistant, Dennis Finch (David Spade). During the 2002-2003 season, "Just Shoot Me" also welcomes Blush's newest hire, Vicki Costa (Rena Sofer), Brooklyn hairstylist who serves as Jack's guru of style and confidante.
