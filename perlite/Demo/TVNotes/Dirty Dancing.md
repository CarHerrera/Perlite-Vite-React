Love story meets comedy in yet another attempt to transfer a popular movie to TV. The setting is a summer resort  in upstate New York's Catskill Mountains. Patrick Cassidy replaces Patrick Swayze as Johnny Castle, a dance instructor at the resort. The 17-year old daughter of the resorts owner falls in love with him, greatly frustrating the father. The show had more dancing than episodes or viewers.
