Olsen and Will Scheffer comes Big Love, the story of a man, Bill Henrickson, living in Salt Lake City with his three wives, three houses, and three families.As if normal family life isn't enough trouble, Bill Henrickson (Bill Paxton, Twister, Thunderbirds) has everything in triple: three wives, three houses, three families. Bill's first and only legal wife is Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn, Word of Honor) but he also shares the bedroom with middle wife Nicki (Chloe Sevigny, Boys Don't Cry, Dogville) and youngest wife Margene (Ginnifer Goodwin, Ed, Mona Lisa Smile). Bill also has three new adjoining houses, seven kids, and a booming hardware business. His closest friend and business partner at Home Plus, Don Embry (Joel McKinnon Miller), is also a polygamist. The series kicks in as Bill receives troublesome news about his father Frank (Bruce Dern, Last Man Standing), who lives in rural Utah in a fundamentalist community lead by Bill's father-in-law, the menacing "Prophet" Roman Grant (Harry Dean Stanton, Wild at Heart, The Green Mile). Bill's younger brother Joey (Shawn Doyle, The Eleventh Hour) was once a star athlete in the NFL, but is now getting used to living in the compound with his wife Wanda (Melora Walters, Magnolia, The Butterfly Effect). Bill's mother Lois (Grace Zabriskie, Twin Peaks, Fried Green Tomatoes) is a descendant to the original founder of the Juniper Creek compound, and is still bitter for Roman Grant's hostile takeover for the leadership. Daveigh Chase (The Ring, Lilo & Stitch) plays Roman's latest wife, the child-bride Rhonda.
