After the secret of the Stargate's ninth chevron is discovered, a team of explorers from Earth travels to the unmanned starship Destiny, which was launched by the Ancients hundreds of millenia ago as an experiment. The new crew, not able to control the Destiny's navigation, is forced to complete its original mission. They travel far out into the universe, encountering new races and enemies.
