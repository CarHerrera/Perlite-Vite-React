From award winning producer David E. Kelley ("Ally McBeal", "The Practice" and "Boston Legal") comes Picket Fences, a story of a small town sherrif trying to maintain the town & his family.Sherrif James Brock (Tom Skerrit) is trying to maintain the small town of Rome, Wisconin. His wife Jill (Kathy Baker) is the doctor of the town, daughter Kimberley (Holly Marie Combs), from a previous marriage of Jimmy, is the level headed student growing up in Rome. Jimmy and Jill have two other children, Matthew (Justin Shenkarow) and Zach (Adam Wylie).Trying his best to keep the town in order, Judge Henry Bone (Ray Walston) rules the court room and while he doesn't always stick to the law, he does what is best for the town. Making Judge Bone's job harder is lawer Douglas Wambaugh (Fyvush Finkel), a friend of Judge Bone but an enemy in the court room. Wambaugh goes to extreme lengths to win the case, but he is after all a character!Also around in the town of Rome are D.A John Littelon (Don Cheadle), a straight man for the antics of Wambaugh, the strange Medical Examinor Carter Pike (Kelly Connel) and deputy's Max and Kenny an on & off couple.The town of Rome never ran smoothly though, with a revolving door of mayors along with cows giving birth to humansand an array of people found dead in freezers.While the show was adored by critics, it never quite found great ratings on CBS and was cancelled after 4 seasons. Creator David E. Kelley left his post as Executive Producer after season 3, which brought a different style of show during season 4 - returning only to write 2 stand out episodes that year. Some have suggested this is why the show met its demise when Kelley left. Also the show does reach a fitting conclusion but it comes rather rushed as it was believed the show would be coming back for season 5. Picket Fences remains a class show and now with the first season recently released on DVD you can enjoy it all over again!
