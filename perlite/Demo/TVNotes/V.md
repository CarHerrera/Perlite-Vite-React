When UFOs place themselves over major cities around the world the Visitors claim to come in peace, providing humanity with medical miracles and technological breakthroughs, while different characters become suspicious of the 'V's (visitors) real intentions and try to investigate what is really going on before it is too late so they can claim Victory (V)!

Based on the original 1980s miniseries about alien lizards visiting Earth, this ABC sci-fi project is the brainchild of The 4400 co-creator/exec producer Scott Peters.
