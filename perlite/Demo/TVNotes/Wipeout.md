Jill Wagner, John Henson, and John Anderson host Wipeout, a show in which 24 contestants compete against each other and the clock in hopes of winning the $50,000 prize. In the Qualifier Round, all 24 contestants must complete a course consisting of four obstacles. The twelve contestants with the fastest times advance to the second round. In this round, the top 12 face the Sweeper. The six who last the longest on the Sweeper, move to the third round and the last person standing receives a $1000 bonus. In the third round, the remaining six contestants face an obstacle, such as the Dreadmill or Dizzy Dummy. Two contestants are eliminated during this round and the remaining four contestants advance to the final round - The Wipeout Zone. The final four must complete four obstacles in the Zone. The contestant with the fastest time wins the $50,000 prize.
