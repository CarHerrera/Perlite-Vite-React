Full House ran for eight seasons and was one of the few primetime sitcoms to have more than 190 episodes. Early in its run, Full House received awful reviews for being too "cheesy," but it still became a popular favorite with audiences, even as the reviews remained negative throughout its run.

Set in San Francisco, this is a show about a very loving family headed by Danny Tanner, who became a single father when his wife, Pam Tanner, was killed in a car accident. Pam's brother Jesse, and Danny's best friend Joey Gladstone moved into the house to help Danny raise his three daughters D.J., Stephanie, and Michelle. Although Full House ended in 1995, with syndication, kids are still growing up with the Tanners just like millions did when the show first started.
