A down-on-his-luck journalist takes a job at a disreputable tabloid newspaper, where he discovers that all of the weird, unbelievable, fantastical stories it prints are actually true. Based on Mark Sumner's "News From the Edge" novels, The Chronicle ran for one season on the Sci Fi Channel and starred Rena Sofer, Chad Willett, Reno Wilson, Jon Polito, and, in supporting roles, Curtis Armstrong, and Octavia Spencer.
