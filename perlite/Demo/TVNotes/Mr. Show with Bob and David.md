Mr. Show was the insanely funny, critically loved but HBO-loathed sketch comedy that ran on the channel for 4 years from 1995-1998.

The show was created, executive produced, written and starred comics/writers Bob Odenkirk (The Ben Stiller Show) and David Cross (Arrested Development).  The show also starred Tom Kenny (SpongeBob SquarePants), Jill Talley and John Ennis.  Featured performers/writers included Paul F. Tompkins, Jerry Minor, B.J. Porter, Scott Aukerman, Brian Posehn (Just Shoot Me), and Jay Johnston.  Featured performers included Mary-Lynn Rajskub (24), Brett Paesal, and Sarah Silverman (Greg The Bunny).

The show has spawned a movie based on popular character Ronnie Dobbs in Run Ronnie Run.  After the show, the cast went on tour to colleges all over America and was wildly successfull.  All four seasons are now on DVD. Bob's wife, Naomi Odenkirk, has compiled everything you could ever want to know about the show in her wonderful book, Mr. Show: What Happened.  Bob and David have talked about a Mr. Show reunion, and possibly another movie (Hooray For America?). Bob, Jay, Jerry and John have appeared on David's show, Arrested Development.

The show has been called the only sketch show in America to ever be in the same league as Britain's Monty Python's Flying Circus.  The show is in the vein of Python in that sketches are "linked" together.  Some shows had themes, but many were just random pieces of wackiness thrown in your face like America had never seen (or may ever see) before.  Mr. Show may go down as the best sketch comedy in American TV History.  To think, it lasted only 30 episodes.
