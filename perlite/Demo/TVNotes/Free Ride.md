Free Ride is a partially improvised comedy that follows recent UC Santa Barbara graduate Nate Stahlings (Josh Dean) as he boomerangs home to move back in with his parents in their small Midwestern town, Johnson City, MO. Upon his return, he discovers his mom Margo (Loretta Fox) and dad Bob (Allan Havey) are knee-deep in marriage therapy and his bedroom has been turned into a gym. The good news is that Nate reconnects with cute former-classmate-turned-local-bank-teller Amber Danwood (Erin Cahill); the bad news is she's newly engaged. Nate also hooks up with Mark Dove (Dave Sheridan), a guy who peaked in high school and has been cruising downhill in his monster truck ever since. Dove takes Nate under his "wing" to show him the local party scene, which turns out to be way more mild than wild.
