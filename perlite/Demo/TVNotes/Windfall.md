Money changes everything.

Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to become a millionaire overnight? A group of 20 friends and acquaintances is about to find that out as they win $386 million in lottery on NBC's hot summer drama, Windfall.

At the heart of the events is a close-knit group of four friends. Peter (Luke Perry, Jeremiah, Beverly Hills, 90210) and Nina Schaefer (Lana Parrilla, Boomtown) and their two kids are a seemingly happy family. Underneath, Nina still harbors feelings for her ex-boyfriend from college, Cameron Walsh (Jason Gedrick, Boomtown), rousing the suspicions of his wife Beth (Sarah Wynter, 24).

Sean Mathers (D.J. Cotrona, Skin) is an ex-con with dark secrets that are in danger of being revealed when he wins the jackpot. Damien Cutler (Jon Foster, life as we know it) is a rebellious teenager who seeks independence of his parents. Frankie Townsend (Alice Greczyn, The Dukes of Hazzard, Quintuplets), a 16-year-old girl, finds herself in the middle of a family feud when her separated parents fight over the money.

Rounding out the cast are Malinda Willliams (Soul Food) as Kimberly George, a 22-year-old single mother hoping to start a new life far away from the trailer park, and Jaclyn DeSantis (Luis, Road Trip) as Maggie Hernandez, a nurse who can't wait to spend her share of the fortune.

Windfall is created by executive producer Laurie McCarthy (Felicity) and co-executive producer Gwendolyn Parker (Without a Trace, The Handler).
