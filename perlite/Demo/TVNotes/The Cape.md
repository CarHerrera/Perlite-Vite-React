In fictional Palm City former cop Vince Faraday is framed for murder. Believed to be dead, he takes on the persona of his son's favorite comic book superhero 'The Cape' to clear his name and reunite with his family. Together with a group of former carnies, he fights against the corrupt police, politicians, and ARK Corporation. Unlike the comics, costumed heroes and villains, such as Chess and Scales, do not have superpowers. Fearless investigative blogger Orwell joins in the fight not just with words, as she tends to get violent. The Cape comes from Universal Media Studios and the producing team of Gail Berman and Lloyd Braun.
