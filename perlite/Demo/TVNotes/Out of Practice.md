OUT OF PRACTICE is a comedy about a family of doctors who share little in common other than their professions.  The family consists of Ben Barnes, a couples counselor who is not considered to be a “real” doctor by the rest of the family; his brother Oliver, a good-looking, self-absorbed plastic surgeon; and sister Regina who works as a doctor in the emergency room.  Their parents, Stewart, a gastroenterologist, and Lydia, a highly motivated cardiologist, are going through messy divorce.  While Lydia’s career has eclipsed her soon-to-be ex’s, Stewart is dating his assistant Crystal, who is a patient of Oliver’s.  With all of the chaos in this highly credentialed family, Ben appears to be the only grounded one.
