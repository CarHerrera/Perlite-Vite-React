Skins is a British teen drama aimed at young adults which is at the forefront of Channel 4's quest to bring more British programming to Britain.
Fast-paced and full of angst-ridden fun, this British drama is based on a group of Bristolian teenagers and their personal struggle with highly-charged issues of race, religion, sexuality, drugs and food disorders.
