Back to You is a traditional live-audience sitcom starring sitcom veterans Kelsey Grammer (Cheers, Frasier) and Patricia Heaton (Everybody Loves Raymond) as co-news anchors who reunite at a Pittsburgh television station after they worked together previously in the '90s. Chuck Darling (Kelsey Grammer) is a bit of a womanizer and moved on from Pittsburgh to a large market but his career took a large hit after a terrible on-screen blunder. In the managers' attempt to bring the Pittsburgh newscast back to #1, Chuck Darling makes his return with his former co-anchor Kelly Carr. The creative minds behind the series, Steven Levitan (Just Shoot Me) and Christopher Lloyd (Frasier) are both very experienced in the sitcom realm.
Back to You is produced by 20th Century Fox and Levitan-Lloyd Productions.
