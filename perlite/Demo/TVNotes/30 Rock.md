Dealing with life in a studio at NBC's 30 Rockefeller Plaza (the title is a shortening of that), the show centers around Liz Lemon, played by Saturday Night Live's Tina Fey, who's the head writer of The Girlie Show. When her old boss dies and a new boss comes in (Alec Baldwin as Jack Donaghy), demanding the addition of a volatile former movie star (and re-branding the show TGS with Tracy Jordan in the process), Liz must figure out how to keep things running smoothly without losing her mind.
Jane Krakowski plays Liz's friend Jenna Maroney, the former headlining star who's all too aware her time to rely on her look is running out.
Tracy Morgan plays Tracy Jordan, and out-of-control comedy star whose movie career vanished.
Scott Adsit plays producer (and Liz's confidant) Pete Hornberger.
Judah Freidlander is writer Frank Rossitano, a slovenly man who's into porn and comic books.
Jack McBrayer plays NBC page Kenneth Parcell, a naive Georgia man who seems to always let NYC get the best of him.
