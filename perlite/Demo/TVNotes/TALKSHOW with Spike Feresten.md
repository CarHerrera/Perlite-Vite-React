Emmy-nominated comic Spike Feresten has just splashed down into the seething, shark-infested ocean that is late-night talk TV. TALKSHOW with Spike Feresten is 30 hot minutes of comedy-infused talk, punctuated with sketches and the occasional bold excursion onto the street. Passers-by, celebrity guests, and even the show's staff are all fair game in Feresten's endless mission to inform and amuse.
