A spin-off series from ABC's hit reality show, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette follows one woman in the search for her own Mr. Right from a pool of 25 eligible young men. After several weeks of meeting different men, going on amazing dates, and learning about their home lives, The Bachelorette will have the opportunity to continue dating one bachelor in the real world by presenting them with a single, red rose.  Before this can happen, The Bachelorette must follow a gradual process of elimination, as her initial 25 bachelors are narrowed down week by week.  At any point along the way, should a man decide that he is no longer interested in The Bachelorette, he may reject her invitation to continue dating.

This unique dating process will give both the bachelors and bachelorette an unforgettable experience and an opportunity to make new friendships and quite possibly find true love, but after all of this, will the man she chooses accept her rose, and if he does will he pop the question?

After being off the air for 3 years the series began again on Monday night, 19 May 2008 with its' 4th season, and now the 5th season is coming up.
