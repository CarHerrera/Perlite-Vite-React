From the creators of Project Runway and America's Next Top Model comes the fashion world's newest reality television creation - Stylista. In the series, eleven aspiring fashionistas face weekly scrutinous challenges under the leadership of Elle's Fashion News Director, Anne Slowey. A tough person to please, Slowey will inspect the contestants' performances after each challenge and with the help of her team ultimately choose a winner. Although the work throughout the competition is quite difficult, the winner will be rewarded for their hard work with a paid editorial position at Elle, a paid lease on a New York City apartment, and an allowance at H&M for one year - an overall package with a value of $100,000.

Stylista is produced by 10x10 Entertainment, Bankable Productions, Magic Molehill Productions, and Warner Horizon Television. The series has been given an 8 episode order for its first season.
