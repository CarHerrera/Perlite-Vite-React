Beginning 03 March 1946, and spanning over 50 years, 4,400 people were abducted in a blinding flash of light.

14 August 2004: A comet is due to fly-by Earth harmlessly. However, the comet's course suddenly changes to an impact trajectory, and the combined nuclear arsenals of multiple nations fail to destroy it. When the comet appears to slow down &mdash; as if it's coming in for a landing &mdash; 4,400 people are deposited in explosion over Highland Beach (Capilano Lake, British Columbia, Canada).

The returnees &mdash; "The 4400" &mdash; have been missing from months to years. None have any memory of where they've been, none have aged, and a small number are beginning to manifest paranormal abilities.

Theme Song: "A Place In Time" (performed by Amanda Abizaid)

The 4400 was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and produced by CBS Paramount in association with Sky Television, Renegade 83 and American Zoetrope.
