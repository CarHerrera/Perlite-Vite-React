Patricia Arquette stars as a young wife and mother who, since childhood, has been struggling to make sense of her dreams and visions of dead people.

Allison DuBois (Arquette) is a strong-willed young mother of three, a devoted wife and law student who begins to suspect that she can talk to dead people, see the future in her dreams, and read people's thoughts. Fearing for her mental health, she turns for support to her husband Joe (Jake Weber), an aerospace engineer, who slowly comes to believe that what his wife is telling him just might be true. The real challenge is convincing her boss, D.A. Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) -- and the other doubters in the criminal justice system -- that her psychic abilities can give them the upper hand when it comes to solving violent and horrific crimes whose mysteries often reside with those who live beyond the grave.

Sofia Vassilieva and Maria Lark also star as Ariel and Bridgette, the eldest two DuBois children. David Cubitt stars as Detective Lee Scanlon, who Allison often works with on cases.

During season three Joe lost his job, and he developed an invention during season four that led him to a new job opportunity. At the end of season three, Allison's abilities were discovered by the public, causing Devalos to be removed from his position as the D.A. and Allison to lose her job. Season four saw Allison finding a new working partner, while she still sometimes worked with Scanlon and helped Devalos in an effort to get his job back.  At the end of season four, Devalos reclaimed his position as the D.A. of Phoenix and hired Allison to work for him once again.  The program's fifth season saw Allison returning to the D.A.'s office, her powers more interesting and varied than ever. With her secret out in the open, Allison gained some unique opportunities, but also sometimes had to work to fend off requests for things such as private readings

At the end of the 2008-09 season, NBC canceled Medium, but CBS (which produces the series) announced that it was picking it up.
