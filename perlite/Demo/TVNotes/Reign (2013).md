However, things between Mary and Francis are not simple and, although they are attracted to eachother, Francis remains hesitant. Also, Bash, Francis' half-brother, complicates matters when he starts falling for Mary. This, together with King Henry's infidelity, makes Queen Mary seek help from the seer Nostradamus. He scares her with a prophecy about her son's death so she becomes determined to save Francis' life at any cost. Conspiracy, sabotage, mystery and sex show the details of the French Court as Mary learns to deal with each and every one.
