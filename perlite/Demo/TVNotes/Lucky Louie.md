Lucky Louie, which Emmy-winning writer-producer Louis C.K. also wrote, centers on a middle-class couple with a kid. Louis C.K. will play the father. He also will executive produce the HBO Independent Prods. project with his manager at 3 Arts Entertainment, Dave Becky. The show was hot in front of a live audience, stems from Louis C.K.'s development deal with HBO. This was HBO's first attempt at a traditional five camera sitcom, but it ulitmately failed to find viewers and was cancelled after airing all 12 episodes that were ordered.
