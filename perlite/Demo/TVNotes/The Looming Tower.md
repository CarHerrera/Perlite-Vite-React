Despite orders to share information about potential terrorists with John O'Neill (Jeff Daniels), the head of the New York FBI's Counter-Terrorism unit, CIA analyst Martin Schmidt (Peter Sarsgaard) withholds it, believing only the CIA can handle terrorist threats in this 10-part drama based on Lawrence Wright's non-fiction book about how infighting between FBI and CIA may have led to the rise of Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda in the late 1990s.
