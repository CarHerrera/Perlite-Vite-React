'Til Death Do Us Part is murder-mystery based on a reality history. As dark and irreverent a series as would be expected with cult movie writer/director John Waters hosting. Waters is the "Groom Reaper", a guest at the happy couple's wedding. The marriage starts out well enough, but goes very wrong along the way. Perhaps the most unusual twist for this series is that you don't know which of the couple is the one murdered, until the end.
