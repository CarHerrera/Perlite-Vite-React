Andy Millman has given up his day job to be an actor, but finds he just can't land the big parts. In fact he's never even had a speaking role, so spends much of his time hanging around on set with fellow extra and best friend Maggie Jacobs. Andy envies the A-list stars but never misses an opportunity to ingratiate himself with them, hoping it will lead to that first elusive line of dialogue.
